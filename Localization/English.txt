C1M0E1_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_002
------
Recruits! You have just joined the Company. This is your new family. Everything that has gone before is your own affair. Here, we are all brothers and sisters!
------
C1M0E1_intro_2
------
VO_CU1_003
------
The Company! You fight for it! It fights for you!
------
C1M0E1_intro_3
------
VO_CU1_004
------
Let's start with the basics: attack and counter-attack.
------
C1M0E1D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_008
------
Come on recruits! We don't want to be here all night! Break through those lines! And get a move on!
------
C1M0E1D1_outro_1
------
VO_CU1_048
------
Well done recruits. You're starting to understand discipline. Now let's get down to business!
------
C1M0E2_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_010
------
Lesson 2. Deploying troops on the battlefield, otherwise known as the importance of keeping one eye on the enemy and the other on your own resources.
------
C1M0E2D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_012
------
Give it all you've got! Put your backs into it! Look at officer Ga'arend. The only thing he's scared of is his mother! Consider that a lesson!
------
C1M0E2D1_intro_2
------
VO_CU1_013
------
Myranda is too harsh. They seem young but brave. Perhaps their fists do not yet strike hard, but their hearts are ready to bleed.
------
C1M0E2D1_outro_1
------
VO_CU1_016
------
I hope that you will be better in a real battle. But Ga'arend is right, your heart is certainly in it.
------
C1M0E3_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_017
------
Today's lesson was that we are all different. We need to concentrate on our strengths and combine them if we are to achieve victory!
------
C1M0E3D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_022
------
Take Sayuri, for example. She wields a pen, not a sword. She writes down everything that the Company does! So, now you know what you have to do to go down in history: win!
------
C1M0E3D1_intro_2
------
VO_CU1_023
------
…
------
C1M0E4_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_025
------
Ga'arend tried to talk to Sayuri yesterday.
------
C1M0E4_intro_2
------
VO_CU1_026
------
Hmm… It's a little difficult to chat with a mute. That's why she's our scribe. We ask only that she write, not talk.
------
C1M0E4_intro_3
------
VO_CU1_027
------
Ga'arend drew shapes on the ground.
------
C1M0E4_intro_4
------
VO_CU1_028
------
Ah… Rather ingenious coming from you. And?
------
C1M0E4_intro_5
------
VO_CU1_029
------
Ga'arend does not know if she understood. She frowned, and then she left.
------
C1M0E4D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_032
------
Ga'arend, I don't want to be rude, but you do have that effect on women. Talking of which, I have to go and teach the new recruits the importance of Magic on the battlefield.
------
C1M0E4D1_intro_2
------
VO_CU1_049
------
Come on! Show Ga'arend what you're made of!
------
C1M0E5_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_034
------
Right, I should remind you that you've just joined an elite company. We aren't just vulgar mercenaries, we're Windswords and don't forget it!
------
C1M0E5_intro_2
------
VO_CU1_035
------
Our services cost a pretty penny, but it's your sweat that earns your pay.
------
C1M0E5_intro_3
------
VO_CU1_036
------
Hmm… Gold is not as precious as glory and the respect of our ancestors. It is the price of your blood.
------
C1M0E5D1_outro_1
------
VO_CU1_041
------
Well done men! You're becoming real pros! Right, a quick break and afterwards it's the last session of the day.
------
C1M0E6_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_043
------
Watch yourself! Captain Kieran will be watching your training in person!
------
C1M0E6_intro_2
------
VO_CU1_044
------
Windswords, is it glory you seek? Riches? Action? Your wish shall soon be granted! We set out tomorrow at dawn.
------
C1M0E6_intro_3
------
VO_CU1_050
------
Thanks, chief. Recruits, you heard the captain. Now show him how we fight in the Company!
------
C1M0E6D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_045
------
This will be our final training session, but in real life conditions this time! Show the Captain what you're made of! You were made to fight!
------
C1M0E6_outro_2
------
VO_CU1_046
------
It's moments like this that remind me why I joined this company.
------
C1M0E6_outro_3
------
VO_CU1_047
------
Right, one last night of sleep. Tomorrow, the real business starts, and I get the impression we have some tough times ahead…
------
C1M0E6_outro_1
------
VO_CU1_051
------
Well done lads, I'm proud of you!
------
C1M0E1Tuto1_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_058
------
Recruits! You have just joined the Company. This is your new family. You will now start with the basics of fighting
------
C1M0E2Tuto1_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_059
------
Never let your guard down. Show us that you belong!
------
C1M0E3Tuto1_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_060
------
Fight with all your might and march to victory!
------
C1M0E4Tuto1_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_061
------
It is now time to crush your enemies with magic and destiny!
------
C1M0E5Tuto1_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_062
------
Recruits, it is your last important lesson. Don't forget who you are and above all, who you are fighting for!
------
C1M0E6Tuto1_intro_1
------
VO_CU1_063
------
Now, show us what your army is really made of. Don't let us down!

C1M1E1_intro_1
------
VO_CU2_013
------
It is with great joy that I begin this new diary, telling of the deeds of the Company, with this phrase: Flammschrein, Wolf Duchy.
------
C1M1E1_intro_2
------
VO_CU2_014
------
We are to meet Field Marshal Brightblade right here… in this dark, forbidding city, known as the headquarters of the Saintly Inquisition...
------
C1M1E1_intro_3
------
VO_CU2_015
------
Windswords, I am Field Marshal Brightblade. You now serve the Saintly Empire and are under my command! The Orcs have invaded the Pale Prairies and are terrorising the inhabitants of the Free Cities.
------
C1M1E1_intro_4
------
VO_CU2_016
------
The Wolf Duchy wishes to aid its neighbours. You have to repel the hordes of savages back to the mountains. Come back to me afterwards and report.
------
C1M1E1_intro_5
------
VO_CU2_017
------
The Field Marshal was right; a band of Orc looters had descended into the valley and ransacked the Free City of Vradek's Crossing. A routine mission, or so it seemed…
------
C1M1E1D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU2_068
------
Hmm... Ever since Orcs came into this world, the Wolf Duchy has hunted them down. Ga'arend wants to be sure that he is fighting plunderers and not families chased from their ancestral homelands...
------
C1M1E1D1_intro_2
------
VO_CU2_069
------
Ga'arend, we are Windswords... soldiers. We are here to follow orders, not ask questions.
------
C1M1E1D1_intro_3
------
VO_CU2_070
------
More and more soldiers to oppose my people! But my people never flee combat! Brothers? Attack! Raaaaa!
------
C1M1E1_outro_1
------
VO_CU2_024
------
Recruits, it is time you met Officer Vein. He will now explain our tactics to you. Do as he says - it will keep you alive!
------
C1M1E1_outro_2
------
VO_CU2_025
------
Thank you Captain… The survivors told us that the bandits came from the river Serpentine. That's where we are going.
------
C1M1E1_outro_3
------
VO_CU2_026
------
Hear that, soldiers? We continue towards the east and shall set up camp near the river. Forward!
------
C1M1E2_intro_1
------
VO_CU2_029
------
Following Kieran's orders, we set up our first camp near the water's edge. Night fell… when suddenly we found ourselves the target of enemy projectiles.
------
C1M1E2_intro_2
------
VO_CU2_030
------
Soldiers! Enemy fire from the river!
------
C1M1E2D1_outro_1
------
VO_CU2_032
------
Hey there, let's calm things down here men. I think this may be a case of mistaken identity. If I'm not mistaken, you are in fact not looters after all. Am I right?
------
C1M1E2D1_outro_2
------
VO_CU2_033
------
Ga'arend is a soldier, not a looter.
------
C1M1E2D1_outro_3
------
VO_CU2_034
------
Yeah, OK, if you say so. Listen men, let's let bygones be bygones, OK? This is all a big misunderstanding. Looking at your shabby clothes, it's hardly surprising we mistook you for ne'er-do-wells.
------
C1M1E2_outro_1
------
VO_CU2_035
------
We are the Windswords. The Wolf Duchy has hired us to rid them of the Orcs terrorising the region. And who might you be?
------
C1M1E2_outro_2
------
VO_CU2_036
------
They call me Crag Hack… What, you've never heard of me before? The fearsome Pirate King of the Savage Sea, he who slashed Medusa's head from her body...
------
C1M1E2_outro_3
------
VO_CU2_037
------
Strange, it wasn't that long ago. People forget quickly nowadays. To tell you the truth, we have been washed up here, far from our lands.
------
C1M1E2_outro_4
------
VO_CU2_038
------
Then those blasted plunderers jumped us! They got the welcome they deserved, and fell back to the Twilight Falls.
------
C1M1E3_intro_1
------
VO_CU2_041
------
As we made our way further and further up the river, the number of bands of Orc increased. We were on the right track.
------
C1M1E3_intro_2
------
VO_CU2_042
------
And so we arrived at a huge waterfall, at the foot of which was stationed a threateningly large collection of Orcs and similar creatures: Goblins, Harpies, Vultures…
------
C1M1E3D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU2_045
------
May Father Sky hear the prayer of Shaar. Tonight, Shaar will read the future of the Blackskull clan in the bones of soldiers!
------
C1M1E3D1_outro_1
------
VO_CU2_071
------
Blades-sold-for-gold, this time you have beaten Shaar. Shaar goes, but will come back. And Shaar will wash the gold from your swords with your own blood!
------
C1M1E3_outro_1
------
VO_CU2_046
------
Shaar swears to Father Sky - we shall meet again, strangers! Shaar will avenge the honor of her people. Shaar will spear your heads on the lances of the Blackskull clan!
------
C1M1E4_intro_1
------
VO_CU2_052
------
However, we were stopped in our tracks by soldiers bearing the Griffin coat of arms…
------
C1M1E4_intro_2
------
VO_CU2_053
------
Order of the Griffin Duchy. No stranger may cross the Darkwood Forest.
------
C1M1E4_intro_3
------
VO_CU2_054
------
There's no time. We have to cross this barrage, whatever the cost.
------
C1M1E4D1_outro_1
------
VO_CU2_060
------
Mercenaries! If your men sheathe their weapons, we are prepared to let you pass!
------
C1M1E4D1_outro_2
------
VO_CU2_061
------
It is not for the vanquished to impose terms on the conqueror.
------
C1M1E4D1_outro_3
------
VO_CU2_062
------
We did not come to fight against the Griffins. We came to lend our force to the Wolves. Talking of which, the Field Marshal awaits us.
------
C1M1E4D1_outro_4
------
VO_CU2_072
------
You're right Vein, let's go. Next time, those arrogant Griffins will think twice before provoking us.
------
C1M1E4_outro_1
------
VO_CU2_063
------
The Griffin soldiers followed us into the forest, when all of a sudden a wall of greenery popped up in front of them, blocking their way.
------
C1M1E4_outro_2
------
VO_CU2_064
------
Someone had used magic to stop them from following us, but who? I knew it wasn't Myranda. Who else could it be?...
------
C1Mission2
------
CU3
------
C1M2E1_intro_1
------
VO_CU3_008
------
Our rest was not to last long… Barely had we laid down than the door flew open and a soldier collapsed in, his body shaking with spasms, apparently due to some quick-acting poison.
------
C1M2E1_intro_2
------
VO_CU3_009
------
Help! They… They are trapped! Down there… still… alive…. Arrghh………………
------
C1M2E1_intro_3
------
VO_CU3_010
------
That's where the Field Marshal is! Let's go!
------
C1M2E1_intro_4
------
VO_CU3_011
------
We entered the catacombs, the air thick with green dust. Breathing was difficult, and among the chilling piles of bones and skulls…
------
C1M2E1_intro_5
------
VO_CU3_012
------
A nightmarish vision. Soldiers lying on the ground, bodies twisted into abominable shapes, skin scorched black, eyes rolled back in their heads, green foam dribbling from their lips…
------
C1M2E1D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU3_017
------
Well well, who do I see within this sad collection of warm-bloods? A renegade… Lord Irvin… The Reaper of Souls…
------
C1M2E1D1_intro_2
------
VO_CU3_081
------
I have forsaken that name and all it represents. Unlike you, I have not chosen to become an aberration…
------
C1M2E1D1_intro_3
------
VO_CU3_082
------
Well, as immortality seems to be a burden for you, let me free you of it. Your lips shall savour the embrace of the True Death!
------
C1M2E1D1_outro_1
------
VO_CU3_020
------
Why have you contaminated the catacombs? Why do the masters of Nar-Heresh concern themselves with the town of Flammschrein?
------
C1M2E1D1_outro_2
------
VO_CU3_021
------
Simply visit the Whispering Forest and you will see for yourself, renegade…
------
C1M2E1_outro_1
------
VO_CU3_022
------
Field Marshal! Are you alright?
------
C1M2E1_outro_2
------
VO_CU3_023
------
*cough* *cough* I'm fine. Tend to the others first… *cough* We must get back to the surface. The air here is sullied by this poison… *cough*
------
C1M2E1_outro_3
------
VO_CU3_024
------
Back on the surface, Kieran and the Field Marshal soon came to an agreement. The company would go on a reconnaissance mission in the Whispering Forest.
------
C1M2E1_outro_4
------
VO_CU3_025
------
Vein tried to warn them, arguing that it was most likely a trap, but Kieran wouldn't listen, and neither would the Field Marshal.
------
C1M2E2_intro_1
------
VO_CU3_026
------
Vein isn't your real name. You've hidden that from us, and who knows what else?
------
C1M2E2_intro_2
------
VO_CU3_027
------
Don't we all have our secrets? The Company is a good mother to us. In exchange for our devotion, she cares little about our past.
------
C1M2E2_intro_3
------
VO_CU3_028
------
Vein's misgivings were soon confirmed. No sooner had we advanced into the deep foliage than a cohort of Undeads barred our path.
------
C1M2E2D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU3_032
------
Death is the only law. You too shall know the kiss of the Spider Goddess! Your passion will shall be dissolved in the eternal purity of her venom!
------
C1M2E2D1_intro_2
------
VO_CU3_033
------
You will soon understand that the world of flesh and blood is but lies and blasphemy! Death is the only truth!
------
C1M2E2D1_intro_3
------
VO_CU3_083
------
This blood that flows is not mine. As long as the venom of the Spider Goddess gives me the force to move, I shall fight!
------
C1M2E2D1_intro_4
------
VO_CU3_084
------
Why fear your demise? I have broken the cycle of life. Death is the only law!
------
C1M2E2D1_outro_1
------
VO_CU3_034
------
The spider monster talked too much. Make Ga'arend sick. Ga'arend prefers listening to Myranda.
------
C1M2E2D1_outro_2
------
VO_CU3_035
------
Thank you Ga'arend. A compliment from an Orc, now there's a rare thing!
------
C1M2E2D1_outro_3
------
VO_CU3_085
------
Myranda should watch her tongue. Ga'arend might feel need to cut it off…
------
C1M2E2_outro_1
------
VO_CU3_036
------
What are the Necromancers doing around here?... There's something I don't quite understand…
------
C1M2E2_outro_2
------
VO_CU3_037
------
We have to find out what's going on, and rid the forest of this tainted magic. Let's go!
------
C1M2E3_intro_1
------
VO_CU3_041
------
Impure feet dare to sully the sacred ground of our temple!!...
------
C1M2E3_intro_2
------
VO_CU3_042
------
Strangers, you are not welcome in the sanctuary of the Spider Goddess.
------
C1M2E3_intro_3
------
VO_CU3_043
------
It is your magic that is not welcome in this land. It is perversion, an insult to the Darkness!
------
C1M2E3D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU3_050
------
Mortals! You offend my Goddess. You shall suffer a thousand deaths and a thousand torments. She shall suck the life from you, leaving but a carcass bereft of its soul!
------
C1M2E3D1_outro_1
------
VO_CU3_053
------
You… The renegade… We shall seek you out! And we will give your soul to the Goddess as an offering. You shall be her plaything, a puppet, a ghoul!...
------
C1M2E3D1_outro_2
------
VO_CU3_054
------
I don't know everything about your past, but it would seem the Spider Goddess particularly dislikes you. Did you break her heart or something? Naughty boy…
------
C1M2E3D1_outro_3
------
VO_CU3_055
------
…
------
C1M2E3D1_outro_4
------
VO_CU3_056
------
I'll take that as a no.
------
C1M2E3_outro_1
------
VO_CU3_057
------
Just at that moment we received a message from Brightblade. He had regained control of Flammschrein and was sending a detachment to hunt down the last of the Undeads.
------
C1M2E3_outro_2
------
VO_CU3_058
------
He also asked us to assist the city of Denstadt. The city had been ransacked by the Orcs.
------
C1M2E4_intro_1
------
VO_CU3_064
------
When we arrived, the town was already stricken with flames and surrounded by the Orc armies. I just hoped that all was not lost…
------
C1M2E4D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU3_066
------
Blades-sold-for-gold! Shaar demands vengeance!
------

Ga'arend's rage burns fiercer that Shaar's, but Kassar is a great champion. Kassar will avenge Shaar and the honor of the Blackskull clan... Mother Earth, Shaar offers you her bones...

What does a tribe of Orcs have in common with the Undeads? Absolutely nothing. And yet, we fight one, then the other. Don't you see? Someone is manipulating us.

Vein was the first to sense that there was something else. The real aim of this mission beingkept from us. But it was too soon. I couldn't tell them...

It was at this moment that the link with the Field Marshal broke. Myranda tried to re-establish it, in vain. Doubt filled our minds.

C1M2E4_outro_4

No directives, no bonuses. Voices were starting to be raised. Kieran had to silence them and ordered us on. We had to honor our commitment to drive back the Orcs.

We followed the Orcs' trail which led us to the edge of the Deep Mountains. At the end of a narrow pass, Griffin banners rose once again before us.

Mercenaries! Turn back! This territory is under the control of the Holy Empire!

Chief, that was a dangerous gamble. Our show of force could well have backfired...

That cursed Archangel got only what he deserved. I despise the hypocrisy and arrogance of the servants of Elrath…

The Griffins were unable to follow us. A violent sandstorm, as sudden as it was unexpected, rose up behind us.

Father Sky was by our sides today.

After several days' difficult walk on craggy, twisting paths, we arrived at the Wyvern Pass. Crossing this place was to prove a long, exhausting trial.

C1M3E2_intro_2

VO_CU4_025

Surrounded by dizzyingly high rock faces, the plateau was pummelled by a strong wind that whistled in our ears. We leaned into the wind and slowly tried to advance…

Strangers! You are on sacred Blackskull land! Usun will cleave your heads open and drink your blood!

Brother Orc, respect the vow of Usun. Allow my ashes to be given over to Mother Earth and Father Sky.

Usun fought well. Ga'arend would like to respect his wishes.

Hmm… Let it be, Ga'arend. The vultures will take care of it. His remains shall be scattered to the four winds.

C1M3E2_outro_1

VO_CU4_027

Ga'arend said nothing. Indeed he remained silent for the rest of our journey to the foot of this strange mountain, its slopes chiselled in shimmering black stone.
------
C1M3E3_intro_1
------
VO_CU4_033

We were in the heart of Blackskull territory… Before us rose thousands of skulls, speared on lances. A macabre custom…

My head… I… It's strange… As if my spirit were floating outside my body…

Are you alright chief? Are you tired? I know of some wild plants that may help you focus.

Silence! Ga'arend hears the songs of Blackskulls.

Good. Fighting will help me get my ideas sorted.
------
C1M3E3D1_intro_1

VO_CU4_046

I am Ga'arend, blade of the wind. I have beaten Shaar, I have beaten Usun. Now your blood will nourish the flesh of Mother Earth!

Blades-sold-for-gold, you will go no further! The blood of Urgash belongs to the Orcs!

C1M3E3D1_intro_3

The blood of Urgash… Chaos crystals… Now I understand the horrible mutations on the bodies of those Orcs.
------
C1M3E3_outro_1
------
VO_CU4_047
------
Myranda was right. In the shadow of these dark mountains, dragonblood crystals were hiding. The blood of the Dragon God Urgash, spilled during the primordial wars.
------
C1M3E3_outro_2
------
VO_CU4_048
------
The blood of a god, solidified and crystallised over centuries… Pure, concentrated magic. The crystals could not be allowed to fall into the wrong hands…
------
C1M3E3_outro_3
------
VO_CU4_049

Fortunately, Kieran decided to carry on. The men followed him without hesitation. It has to be said, Myranda did insist about the immense value of the crystals. Humans are so greedy...
------
C1M3E4_intro_1
------
VO_CU4_056

Myranda could feel a powerful, ancient force radiating from the summit. Slowly, we climbed up the dark rock. What we found at the top was beyond our imagination…
------
C1M3E4_intro_2
------
VO_CU4_057
------
A lake filled with crystal clear water, in the centre of which stood tall structures hewn from the purest, most sparkling diamond…
------
C1M3E4_intro_3
------
VO_CU4_058
------
The Pillar of Lights! If one stares at the crystals for long enough, flashes of the past or the future are revealed…
------
C1M3E4_intro_4

But if you look for too long, the Void will claim you.

Ga'arend sees in the crystal. He sees… He sees an army of demons. Behind us!
------
C1M3E4D1_outro_1
------
VO_CU4_065

That's enough! About turn! These mercenaries are not our enemies. On the contrary, they will help us. I have seen it in the Pillar.
------
C1M3E4D1_outro_2
------
VO_CU4_088
------
Wait! I too see something in the Pillar… We are consulting ancient books, aided by a Blind Brother!
------
C1M3E4_outro_1
------
VO_CU4_066
------
A Blind Brother? It has to be the monastery at Helexia. The Blind Brothers serve Destiny. They are historians, soothsayers. They will know how to guide us in our quest.
------
C1M3E4_outro_2
------
VO_CU4_067

Helexia? And… it's on our way?

C1M3E4_outro_3

Yes, not far from here. Ga'arend can take you there. He knows the way.
------
C1M3E4_outro_4
------
VO_CU4_069

Ga'arend is happy to see the Blind Brothers again. Ga'arend has counted many winters since he left.
------
C1M3E4_outro_5

VO_CU4_070

Ga'arend's words surprised everyone, including myself. I was unaware he knew the Blind Brothers.
------
C1M3E4_outro_6
------
VO_CU4_071

That would not be our only surprise... What Kieran saw in the Pillar of Light was unavoidable, and pushed him to abandon us, no later than the next day.

With their hearts no longer in it, the men were troubled... What had Kieran seen in the Pillar? Where had he gone? What would we do without him?
------
C1M4E1_intro_2
------
VO_CU5_003
------
The next day, he was gone without saying a word, without leaving a note. An evil spell seemed to be upon us - first the Company had lost contact with the Field Marshal, now it had lost its leader.
------
C1M4E1_intro_3
------
VO_CU5_004
------
I was angry at myself. I had sacrificed Kieran, our Captain. Could things have gone differently? The Blind Brother had said it was woven into the tapestry of Destiny...
------
C1M4E1_intro_4
------
VO_CU5_005
------
But this was no time for self-pity. Suddenly, we came across the demonist we had confronted near the Pillar of Lights. She was in the midst of a battle against a female opponent.
------
C1M4E1D1_intro_1
------

It is written that you must come to my aid! I have seen it in the Pillar of Lights! That is why I stopped fighting you.

Help a demonist? Nothing more than an apprentice perverted by the power of Chaos! May you burn in the fire of your own madness, sorceress!

If this girl knows something, we have to help her. Attack!

Thank you mercenaries, I must take my leave, but we shall meet again soon.

Ga'arend, we are happy to see you again, my son. Allow your friends to enter. We have been expecting you.

"My son?"… Monks gave birth to an Orc?
------
C1M4E2_intro_3

VO_CU5_104

Ga'arend is like a son to us. We welcomed him here and took care of him. He lived amongst us for several years before going back to his brothers.
------
C1M4E2_intro_4
------
VO_CU5_105
------
In the manuscripts of our scriptorium, you will find - I hope - the answers to your questions. Ga'arend, show them how to use our library.
------
C1M4E2_intro_5
------
VO_CU5_106
------
Ga'arend, you know how to read?... Or do you just look at the pretty drawings?
------
C1M4E2_intro_6
------
VO_CU5_107
------
Once more, Myranda had underestimated Ga'arend. With his help, we discovered ancient manuscripts that allowed us learn more about our enemy's nature.
------
C1M4E2_intro_7
------
VO_CU5_108
------
My companions discovered who our real enemy was. The Order of the Void, an occult congregation that feeds off a primordial force, the oldest know to Ashan.
------
C1M4E2_intro_8
------
VO_CU5_109
------
The original Void. The beginning and the end. Before the Cosmic Egg, the Dragon Gods of Order and Chaos or the Six Elements.
------
C1M4E2_intro_9
------
VO_CU5_110
------
A boundless, unyielding force. But what mortal would be strong enough or crazy enough to think they could control it? That is what we must find out…
------
C1M4E2_intro_10
------
VO_CU5_111

Windswords, the time for studying has passed. The Griffins are at the gates of the Monastery. If you wish to continue your voyage, we must meet them in battle.
------
C1M4E2D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU5_045

Mercenaries, we meet again! This time you will not escape! Tomorrow's dawn will see your crucified bodies greeting the sunrise!
------
C1M4E2_outro_1
------
VO_CU5_047

Now you should leave. To reach your destination, you must cross the Halls of Amnesia. Ga'arend will take you there.
------
C1M4E3_intro_1
------
VO_CU5_056

The Halls of Amnesia were in a tunnel scraped into the rock. A long corridor of permanent ice, polished by time, as smooth as a mirror.
------
C1M4E3_intro_2

As a child, I had been warned to never look into it, for fear of losing my memories or even my identity.
------
C1M4E3_intro_3

But we didn't even have time to look. A rift suddenly opened from the spirit plane, vomiting forth a Demon Lord, accompanied by several legions…
------
C1M4E3D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU5_061

Mortals! You will never find the Chaos crystals! I am Phrias, Prince of Annihilation. Even yesterday I served my lord Ur-Khrag, Overlord of Destruction.

Mercenaries! It is as I have promised! Now lend me your strength!

No-one asked you, sorceress!

We have every reason to unite our forces, Mageblade! We want the same thing - to stop the others from seizing the blood of Urgash!
------
C1M4E3D1_intro_5
------
VO_CU5_065

Comrades, it would be stupid to refuse her help. There will be time later to revise the terms of our alliance.

C1M4E3D1_outro_1

You see. You help me, I help you. It's as simple as that. We are even, so I shall go. Who knows, our paths may cross a third time…
------
C1M4E3D1_outro_2
------
VO_CU5_112

The demon did not burn up and return to the heart of Sheogh. It dissolved slowly, giving out a long, sinister, terrifying cry: "The end is only the beginning!"...
------
C1M4E3_outro_1
------
VO_CU5_069
------
There was not even time for my fellow travellers to comprehend the subtleties of what Phrias had said, when suddenly an all too familiar silhouette appeared before us. And I thought we would never see them again...
------
C1M4E3_outro_2
------
VO_CU5_070

I lay my eyes on you for the first time, strangers… To be precise, it is the second time for one of you.

C1M4E3_outro_3

I have been observing you for a while. You have proved yourselves worthy of the next challenge.

C1M4E3_outro_4

Observed? Challenge? First of all, who do you think you are? Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you immediately!

My name is Yukiko. I am the emissary of Shanriya. You will have need of the Nagas to vanquish your enemy.
------
C1M4E3_outro_6

Yukiko guided us to the mountain of eternal snows, home to Shanriya, a place I had hoped never to see again…

Yukiko seems to know Sayuri. Sayuri must also know Yukiko…
------
C1M4E4_intro_2
------
VO_CU5_079

I doubt Sayuri will tell you. She'd have to talk for a start. And like all of us, she probably doesn't want someone raking through her past.
------
C1M4E4_intro_3
------
VO_CU5_080
------
Our elders are impressed by your combats. But we wish to test your cohesion. For this, you will prove that you can beat our champion, Takana Osore.
------
C1M4E4D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU5_083
------
During this duel, no blood must be shed. It is our minds that will fight. You must unite your thoughts and fight as a sole warrior.
------
C1M4E4D1_intro_2
------
VO_CU5_084

The Nagas eat too much rotten fish. It poisons their tongues. They talk strangely.
------
C1M4E4D1_intro_3
------
VO_CU5_085
------
Don't worry Ga'arend, I've understood. They mean that we are not to fight with weapons. We are to wage a battle of minds, like a duel of magic.
------
C1M4E4D1_outro_1
------
VO_CU5_113
------
Impressive, but your real enemy, the Herald of the Void, will be a tougher opponent. Using Urgash blood, he has created a powerful artefact: the Throne of Renewal.
------
C1M4E4D1_outro_2
------
VO_CU5_114
------
If you wish to vanquish him, you must stay together like you did today. The power of the Void is limitless. Do not underestimate it.
------
C1M4E4_outro_1
------
VO_CU5_088
------
Three champions have already been corrupted by the power of the Void. Phrias was the first.
------
C1M4E4_outro_2
------
VO_CU5_089

You will face the second when you go to the Moonsilk Cocoon nest. That is where Ariana of the Severed Fates is hiding.

C1M4E4_outro_3
------
VO_CU5_090
------
Ariana?! Then we should expect the worst.

You know her?

You could say that.

------
C1M5E1_intro_2
------
VO_CU6_018
------
We left Shanriya and descended to a plateau where we entered a dark, humid cave. The rock had been covered with vaporous filaments of silk, glowing, almost ghostlike.
------
C1M5E1D1_intro_1

Silence, abomination! You shall know the True Death!

True Death… What a sham… I have broken the endless cycle of existence. I have triumphed over Life, defeated Death! Finally, I am immortal!
------
C1M5E1D1_intro_4
------
VO_CU6_027

Your mind has become addled, Ariana. The Void denies the teachings of Asha and the very existence of Order and Chaos. This is blasphemy!
------
C1M5E1D1_intro_5

If you return to Nar-Heresh, you will realise that other Necromancers think as I do.

C1M5E1_outro_1
------
VO_CU6_028

Once Ariana had been defeated, Yukiko informed us that the third champion was located in a place called No-Shanriya. Shanriya in reverse, a reflection of the city, its negative.
------
C1M5E1_outro_2
------
VO_CU6_029
------
But before heading off to battle, we needed a new leader. Vein was elected Captain. Everything seemed to be going as planned.
------
C1M5E1_outro_3
------
VO_CU6_030
------
To find No-Shanriya, we had to look to the north and find the hidden reflection, the shadow cast by the city of Naga.
------
C1M5E1_outro_4
------
VO_CU6_031
------
There! I can see a sort of shimmering glimmer of multi-colored light. It must be the gate.
------
C1M5E2_intro_1
------
VO_CU6_034
------
Myranda was right. The strange light was not a mirage but a magical reflection, an enchanted threshold. Inside was the mirror image of Shanriya.
------
C1M5E2_intro_2
------
VO_CU6_035
------
That which was up was now down. Black was white, light was dark… I was immediately ill at ease, as if I had foreseen that…

C1M5E2_intro_3

VO_CU6_036

Sayuri-Sama. I am happy to see you again. You have found a way to come to me. Welcome my sister, welcome to No-Shanriya…

I didn't think I would find her. Anyone but her, not Akane…
------
C1M5E2D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU6_044
------
Sayuri, have you lost the ability to speak? Too much emotion, no doubt… Our destinies are intertwined. I knew we would find each other. We have a mission to accomplish.
------
C1M5E2D1_intro_2
------
VO_CU6_112
------
You do not understand, Sayuri. The universe is angry. Creation is imperfect. It must be destroyed. Remove all that was, erase all that could have been.
------
C1M5E2D1_intro_3
------
VO_CU6_113

Out of the question! Like those before you, you shall taste the icy grasp of the True Death!

Forgive me, dear sister... You died the day you yielded to the Void… To save me… Akane... May the Dragon Gods have pity on you…

But… But you can speak, Sayuri?!

I have always known how to speak. I no longer felt the need, that is all.

Ga'arend does not understand. Sayuri speaks in riddles, like Yukiko. Is this a Naga custom?

Sayuri has a few secrets. As do we all.

The peak upon which nestled No-Shanriya was supported by a strange system of roots. The mountain resembled a huge stone tree with gnarly, twisting bark.

The blood of Urgash had reshaped the rock. While contemplating this fantastical scene, we did not see our enemy approach. Kassar, leader of the Blackskull!
------
C1M5E3_intro_3
------
VO_CU6_062
------
We had left the Orc as a mutilated body, empty-eyed with no spark of life. His rage, with the power of the crystals, allowed him to defy Death and live to fight one final combat…
------
C1M5E3D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU6_066
------
Kassar is not dead! Kassar has returned! The crystals belong to the Blackskull! The Chaos powers must be returned to the Orcs! Kassar will kill the blades-sold-for-gold!
------
C1M5E3D1_intro_2
------

Kassar still alive? Kassar want to join his ancestors? Let him come and Ga'arend promises his blood will flow in the throat of Mother Earth!
------
C1M5E3D1_outro_1
------
VO_CU6_067

Kassar kneels before the valiant strangers who have vanquished him. Kassar goes to join his ancestors. The strangers have earned their trophy. Let them take the horn of Kassar…
------
C1M5E3D1_outro_2
------
VO_CU6_068

Kassar, brave warrior. May Father Sky forgive your mistaken war. May Mother Earth welcome your bones.
------
C1M5E3_outro_1
------
VO_CU6_069
------
Ga'arend insisted that we give Kassar a burial worthy of a great warrior. We respected his wishes.
------
C1M5E3_outro_2
------
VO_CU6_070
------
It was a lesson my comrades reflected upon. Kassar was just a puppet, a victim. In the shadows, the Void was pulling the strings.
------
C1M5E3_outro_3
------
VO_CU6_071
------
We are now not far from the source of Chaos. I can sense it, stronger and stronger.
------
C1M5E3_outro_4
------
VO_CU6_072
------
At last. I am eager to face he who manipulates us all. I hate being somebody's plaything, especially somebody I do not know. Forward!
------
C1M5E4_intro_1
------
VO_CU6_077
------
We arrived in a cave with a cavernous roof. The force of the Chaos magic was palpable, omnipresent. This was the last place I expected to see one of our companions again.
------
C1M5E4D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU6_087
------
Kieran! What are you doing here?
------
C1M5E4D1_intro_2
------
VO_CU6_115

Kieran is no more. I am not Kieran. I am the humble servant of the Void, a knight of the Nothingness.
------
C1M5E4D1_intro_3
------
VO_CU6_116
------
Ga'arend does not understand. Kieran did not leave?
------
C1M5E4D1_intro_4
------
VO_CU6_117

I was forced to choose - Suffering or Absence. I sacrificed myself to save her, her and the others.
------
C1M5E4_outro_1
------
VO_CU6_088
------
On the ground, Kieran's body was seized by violent spasms. The end was near. Only Myranda dared approach him.
------
C1M5E4_outro_2
------
VO_CU6_089
------
It was then that he whispered something in her ear. The face of our Mageblade dropped… What horrible secret had he told her?
------
C1M5E4_outro_3
------
VO_CU6_090
------
Kieran stopped moving. His skin crumbled into a fine dust, dissipating rapidly into the air...
------
C1M5E4_outro_4
------
VO_CU6_118
------
Seeing Kieran like that, unrecognisable, corrupted by the power of the Void, then to see him disintegrate... It was overwhelming. What price victory? Death, insanity, or even worse?
------
C1M5E5_intro_1
------
VO_CU6_091
------
In the heart of the cave, someone unknown was waiting for us, challenging us with his icy stare.
------
C1M5E5_intro_2
------
VO_CU6_092
------
He was sat in a throne of black stone which floated in the air, supported by the magic of the crystals and constantly changing shape as if affected by their chaotic nature.
------
C1M5E5D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU6_097
------
I am the Herald of the Void, the Messenger of the Nothingness. I have an important message to give to the world, but the time has not yet come.
------
C1M5E5D1_intro_2
------
VO_CU6_119
------
You have managed to get this far. You have fought my champions, but your victories are but illusion. There is no use pursuing this futile combat. Lay down your weapons and pledge allegiance to the Void…
------
C1M5E5D1_intro_3
------
VO_CU6_120
------
Join forces with a madman? Someone who crazily denies the existence of the Dragon Gods, the equilibrium of Order and Chaos? In the name of Asha, I cannot!
------
C1M5E5_outro_1
------
VO_CU6_121
------
It's incredible how many narcissistic megalomaniacs think that they are stronger than Death… Most of them deserve their pitiful ends!
------
C1M5E5_outro_2
------
VO_CU6_122
------
We should wait a little before crying victory.
------
C1M5E5_outro_3
------
VO_CU6_123
------
Vein was right. The Herald of the Void's lifeless body stood up slowly and returned to its throne. From beneath its hood, you could feel its stare weighing down upon us, exposing our minds.
------
C1M5E6_intro_1
------
VO_CU6_108
------
Allow me to show you the force of the Void, the power of the Throne of Renewal. I disown my death. I disown my defeat!
------
C1M5E6D1_intro_1
------
VO_CU6_109
------
I have disowned the lies of the Dragon Gods. I am beyond the cycle of Life and Death. I am eternal.
------
C1M5E6D1_outro_1
------
VO_CU6_124
------
You do not understand. You are ignorant, blind. You are but simple memories which will be forgotten little by little by the Universe…
------
C1M5E6_outro_1
------
VO_CU6_110
------
The Herald raised his index finger and Phrias, Ariana, Akane and Kieran materialised at his side. It was more than a resurrection or Undeath provoked by the venom of the Spider Goddess.
------
C1M5E6_outro_2
------
VO_CU6_125
------
It was as if the combat we had just finished had never happened. We never killed them, we hadn't even injured them.
------
C1M5E6_outro_3
------
VO_CU6_126
------
They advanced towards us. Inexorably… But they could not reach us. A mysterious current enveloped us and, with a flash of primordial magic, transported us to the spirit world.

The voyage was over in an instant. Before I had the time to understand what had happened, we found ourselves in the monastery at Helexia, being welcomed by the Blind Brother.
------
C1ME_intro_2
------
VO_CUE_002
------
I am pleased to see you again safe and sound, Windswords. You have proved yourselves worthy of the hopes we have placed in you. What do you say, Sayuri?
------
C1ME_intro_3
------
VO_CUE_003
------
I must admit, they surprised me. They followed the adventure through to the end and were ready to give up their lives to defend a cause, an ideal
------
C1ME_intro_4
------
VO_CUE_004
------
Windswords, you are most certainly the ones we have waited for. Thanks to you, we will be able to fight the forces of the Void.
------
C1ME_intro_5
------
VO_CUE_005
------
And perhaps beat them, Blind Brother.
------
C1ME_intro_6
------
VO_CUE_006
------
Perhaps. Our meeting was woven into the great tapestry of Destiny, but the Void erases the threads of past and future. Final victory is still uncertain.
------
C1ME_intro_7
------
VO_CUE_007
------
Sayuri and Blind Brother have started talking Naga. Ga'arend does not understand any more!
------
C1ME_intro_8
------
VO_CUE_008
------
I do. Since the beginning we have been tricked and manipulated. By the Blind Brother, Kieran, the Herald of the Void. And by you too, Sayuri.
------
C1ME_intro_9
------
VO_CUE_009
------
It was necessary. You needed to have the choice to carry on or give up. I was not to influence you. But I was always on your side. In fact, I am the one who just saved you.
------
C1ME_intro_10
------
VO_CUE_010
------
And so I explained the real aim of this mission to my companions. I had to make sure that they were worthy of my trust, and that with their help I could foil the Void's plan.
------
C1ME_intro_11
------
VO_CUE_011
------
I warned them that they would probably come to forget our adventure as time wore on. Another effect of the Void. It cancelled out everything, even the past of those that got too close to it.
------
C1ME_intro_12
------
VO_CUE_012
------
This is why it was important that I write this diary. It was the only way to preserve our memories.
------
C1ME_intro_13
------
VO_CUE_013
------
The only way not to lose touch with our reality, our lives, our identities, our struggle.
------
C1ME_intro_14
------
VO_CUE_014
------
However, the hardest test was yet to come. The strength of the Void appeared limitless. How were we to beat it?...
------
C1ME_intro_15
------
VO_CUE_015
------
Flee, Windswords. Fly away, far from me. After all, you are but a gust of wind - insignificant, ephemeral.
------
C1ME_intro_16
------
VO_CUE_016
------
We shall meet again before long. My Order is patient. What are months, years, centuries for those who live in the unchanging eternity of the Void?
------
C1ME_intro_17
------
VO_CUE_017
------
But soon, yes soon, we will restore sight to the blind and faith to the unbelievers. Even the deaf shall hear the one and only truth. The universe is nothing. The Void is all!

    Might and Magic Duel of Champions – Terms of Sale
</h2>
<p>
    <u>Last Update: October 15th, 2012</u>
</p>
<p>
    These terms of sale (the “Terms of Sale”) shall govern the purchase of virtual currency (“Credits” or “Virtual Currency”) that the User may obtain in the
online video game entitled “Might and Magic Duel of Champions” (the "Game") and accessible at <a href="http://www.duelofchampions.com/" target="_blank">http://www.duelofchampions.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Terms of Sale are incorporated by this reference to the Terms of Use of UBISOFT, available at the following URL: <a href="http://ubi.com/UK/Info/Info.aspx?tagname=TermsOfUse" target="_blank">http://ubi.com/UK/Info/Info.aspx?tagname=TermsOfUse</a>. All capitalized terms used but not
    defined herein shall have the meaning given to them in the Terms of Use of UBISOFT.
</p>
<p>
    UBISOFT may make available to the User, either free-of charge or in exchange of certain Credits, additional materials which, once added to your Account,
    can be used to maximize your experience within the Game.
</p>
<p>
    All such materials, including without limitation objects, customization elements, boosts, avatars and any other elements which UBISOFT may make available
    to you in the Game are referred to as “Additional Content”.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. </strong>
    <strong><u>Credit purchase</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    At the time of creation of your Account, you may be able to choose between different packs of Credits to be used in the Game.
</p>
<p>
    You must have a valid Account to be able to purchase a pack of Credits.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. </strong>
    <strong><u>Licence </u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Credits may be obtained either free-of charge or by purchasing a pack of Credits.
</p>
<p>
    By purchasing packs of Credits or otherwise acquiring certain Credits, UBISOFT grants the User with a limited license to obtain Additional Content by
    exchanging certain Credits.
</p>
<p>
    The term of such license starts when you acquire such Credits and ends the day when the access to the Credits is suspended, terminated or expired.
</p>
<p>
    All such Credits may be only redeemed for Additional Content in connection with the Game.
</p>
<p>
    When the User redeems certain Credits for Additional Content, UBISOFT grants the User with a personal, non-commercial, limited license to use such
    Additional Content only within the Game.
</p>
<p>
    The User shall not transfer or otherwise exchange the Credits within the Game to other users, except if the Game allows such transfer and/or exchange by
    way of a specific feature within the Game. In any event, the User shall not sell, or otherwise exchange in kind the Credits outside the Game. Failure to
    comply with this provision constitutes a material breach of the Terms of Use of UBISOFT and may result in the termination of your Account specified in the
    Termination Section of the Terms of Use, without prejudice to any other claims for damages or losses by UBISOFT, or other remedies available.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. </strong>
    <strong><u>Pricing</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Your purchase of a pack of Credit does not include the price of the Internet connection required to access the Game and/or the Services or products
    (including but not limited to virtual items) of the Game.
</p>
<p>
    UBISOFT reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify the price of the Credits. You will be informed of these changes on the website of the Game
    before the new price is applied. In all cases, this new price will be applicable to you only for your next purchase of Credits. If you do not accept this
    new price, you will not be able to access the Service anymore.
</p>
<p>
    All invoices and payments are expressed in your local currency and include VAT (and/or other sales taxes).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. </strong>
    <strong><u>Payment</u></strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    You may choose the means of payment from various payment solutions available to you on the management page of your Account.
</p>
<p>
    You must provide UBISOFT with accurate, complete and up-to-date invoicing information, including a valid credit card number and expiry date or other
    information according to the means of payment chosen.
</p>
<p>
    Your pack of Credits is invoiced on a pre-payment basis.
</p>
<p>
    If you choose to pay your Credit Pack using a credit card and your payment is accepted, your credit card will be debited of the amount corresponding to the
    Credit Pack chosen and displayed on the payment page.
</p>
<p>
    The amount paid for each Credit pack credited on your Account is irrevocably forfeited and will not be refunded. Not using your Credits do not entitle you
    to claim a refund for your pack of Credits.
</p>
<p>
    You must pay all costs incurred, including applicable taxes, and pay for all purchases made by you or by any person who uses your Account, including your
    family or your friends or any other person whether authorised by you or not. Unless your Account or payment information is obtained unlawfully or
    fraudulently by a person other than those you have authorised to use your Account, you are responsible for any use made of your Account and for all
    purchases made and costs incurred on your Account.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>5. Use of the Credits </u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Credits are available to you immediately as soon as you complete your purchase.
</p>
<p>
    You have the right to withdraw from your purchase within fourteen calendar days (“Cooling Off Period”), commencing on the day after the date of purchase of
    the service and/or the product of the Game. However, you will lose your right of withdrawal if the performance of the services has begun before the end of
    the Cooling Off Period. Accordingly, you don’t have any withdrawal right as the performance of our services begins immediately once your purchase of
    Credits is completed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>6. No monetary value of the Credits</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding any provision contained herein, whatever the terminology used, Points System, Additional Content, Credits, Virtual Currency have no
    monetary value and may in no case be exchanged or redeemed for “real” currency or in any other way exchanged in kind. You may not sell or transfer
    Additional Content, Credits, Virtual Currency by any means nor buy such Additional Content, Credits and Virtual Currency for any purposes other than their
    use in the Game.
</p>
<p>
    Failure to comply with this Article constitutes a material breach of the Terms of Use of UBISOFT and may result in the termination of your Account
    specified in the Termination Section of the Terms of Use, without prejudice to any other claims for damages or losses by UBISOFT, or other remedies
    available.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>7. Cancellation or suspension</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    UBISOFT may, at its own discretion and without any prior notice, cancel or suspend your access to the Credits, in the event you do not comply with each of
    Terms of Sale herein.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>8. Termination of Credits</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    UBISOFT may discontinue providing pack of Credits for the Game, at any time and without any prejudice toward you. In this event, UBISOFT will give a 30
    (thirty) day prior notice before the termination ofpack of Credits on the website of the Game.

<h1>Welcome</h1> <p class=" "><p class=" ">Welcome to Might &amp; Magic: Duel of Champions (aka DoC), and thank you for joining us on this amazing adventure!</p><p class=" ">The goal of the game is to create interesting and powerful decks to battle against challengers from all over the world. </p> <p class=" "> Read on to discover some useful tips and strategies to get you started. </p> <h1>1/ How to build a deck?</h1> <p class=" "><b> The ideal deck is composed of 59 cards: </b> </p> <ul class=" "><li class=" ">1 Hero</li><li class=" ">8 Events</li><li class=" ">50 Other cards (A mix of creatures, spells or fortunes depending on your preference) </li></ul> <p class=" "> You can create decks with up to 209 cards in them, but keep in mind that each card you add means there is less chance you will draw the cards you want during a duel. <br/>  <br/>A good guide when starting off in DoC is to have more creatures than spells or fortunes in your deck until you know how different cards work. Bigger, more costly cards aren't always better: having lots of small creatures can help you get an early and decisive advantage over your opponent. Choose your cards wisely! </p> <p class=" "><b> The Hero determines the deck you will build. </b> </p> <p class=" "> Each hero in the game has a <b>faction</b>, which determines the creature &amp; fortune cards that you can put into their deck. <br/>There are six factions<b></b> in the game right now - Haven, Necropolis, Inferno, Stronghold, Sanctuary, and a Neutral faction. </p> <p class=" ">For example, the hero Seria, Seeker of the Lost Souls, is from the Nercopolis faction so you can only add Necropolis or Neutral creatures and fortunes to her deck. </p> <p class=" "> Heroes also have knowledge of one or more <b>spell schools</b>, which determine the spell cards you can use in their deck. Seria can only use Dark and Water spells. </p> <p class=" ">There are many different types of decks and strategies. Once you think you have understood how most the cards work, try checking out some of the decks in the forums<i>.  </i> </p> <h1>2/ What to buy in the shop?</h1> <p class=" "> This will vary according to most people's preference, but here is possibly the easiest way for starting off in the game. <br/><b></b></p> <p class=" "><b>Do the tutorial then finish the campaign!</b> This will give you a good amount of starting gold and seals. </p> <p class=" ">After that, go fight a few duels against other players to reach the next level, and, once you have enough seals, buy the Box (or the Serious Box if you can). <br/>This will give you loads of cards and should enable you to start rising up the ranks.</p> <p class=" ">Only buy Heroic Packs if you think you have enough creatures: if you buy a Heroic Pack too soon, you could get a hero from a different faction that you can't use yet as you don't have enough cards of that faction. <br/>  <br/>Only buy consumables (XP and gold boosts) if you know what you are doing. <br/>Buying Swiss Tournament tickets early on may also be counter-productive. <br/>Again, these are just recommended strategies for new players. </p> <h1>3/ What are the game modes?</h1> <p class=" "> When you click the "Play" button at the top of the screen you will be taken to the <b>Classic Duel</b>, which pairs you up against other players of your skill level (ELO) for straight forward duels. This is where you will get your constant flow of gold and experience points. </p> <p class=" ">The Tournament button will take you to the different tournament modes. Depending on what day it is, the official tournament will either be a <b>Jackpot Tournament</b> or a <b>Swiss Tournament</b>. </p> <p class=" ">The Jackpot Tournament will allow you to fight against other players one by one: you start off with 0 points and gradually work your way up the leaderboard if you can. You gain less gold for each duel as most of it is put into the global Jackpot. The higher up the leaderboard you go, the higher the percentage of the jackpot you will win at the end of the day! </p> <p class=" ">The Swiss Tournament will allow you to enter an 8 player group. You will then fight 3 duels, and the best 2 players will get a nice prize. There will also be a lucky prize given to one of the players who comes 3rd to 8th place. To enter a Swiss tournament you need Tickets that can be bought in the shop. You can also create your own <b>Custom Tournaments</b> if you want to practice the Swiss Tournament, but these have no rewards.</p> <p class=" "><b>The tournaments do not unlock until you reach 200 ELO</b>, but in general, we would advise you NOT to enter tournaments until you feel confident you know the game well, as you may face some very experienced players!</p> <h1 class=" ">4/ What is the Infernal Pit?</h1> <p class=" "> You can use the Infernal Pit to burn cards for gold and a small chance to win the special card on offer at that moment. The cards you burn <b>will be gone forever</b> (or until you find new ones in packs)... so don't rush into this. <br/>The special card on offer changes randomly every 8 hours.</p> <p class=" ">  <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;"> The Infernal Pit can be</span>  <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;"> found in the top menu, but it only </span>  <span style="font-weight: bold;">unlocks after you reach level 5</span>  <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">. </span> </p> <h1 class=" ">5/ Where to get more information? </h1> <p class=" ">Take a look at the different sections of the help manual to learn more about the cards and the rules of the battleground. <br/>If you want more information about strategy and general topics, don't forget to check the official forums, the Facebook page, and the Twitter feed!</p> <p class=" "></p> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p id="pp1"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>When does Ubisoft collect your personal information?</strong></p>
<p>Ubisoft  collects your personal information at different times when you interact with  our services, buy or products or otherwise contact us. Whatever the activity  may be, we will only collect information to the extent deemed reasonably  necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to purchase goods  and/or services from our online store, you will need to provide us with a valid  credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, mailing and  billing addresses, phone number and e-mail address.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="pp5"><strong>What personal information Does Ubisoft Collect? </strong></p>
<p>Ubisoft  only collects personal information from you on a voluntary basis. When you  submit personal information to Ubisoft, it will usually take the form of: </p>
<ul>
  <li>product registration</li>
  <li>contest registration</li>
  <li>demo or patch downloads</li>
  <li>registration for game-specific event participation</li>
  <li>shopping at our online store</li>
  <li>Site registration;</li>
  <li>customer service and technical support sessions; and/or </li>
</ul>
<p>The information we collect may include personal information such as your name, date  of birth, e-mail address, phone number, fax number and home address. Visitors purchasing goods or services through our online store will need to provide a  valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to the credit card  holder's name, mailing address, phone number and e-mail address. In addition,  we may collect demographic information such as your age, gender, favourite  styles of gaming and the systems you own or plan to buy. </p>
<p>Ubisoft collects personal information via conventional Internet forms. For example, a  new user to any of the Sites may be asked to register by providing his or her name, phone number, fax number, and home address. This information will then be  associated with your e-mail account, so that you may identify yourself during  future visits to each of the Sites. Ubisoft also stores and maintains personal  information that you submit to us in an e-mail or that you post on our bulletin  board. </p>
<p id="pp6"><strong>What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information? </strong></p>
<p>If  you do not submit personal information when asked by Ubisoft, your refusal may  limit our ability to process your online product registration, contest registration, purchase via our online store, or request for technical support.  However, you do not need to provide personal information to Ubisoft in order to  access and use the Sites. </p>
<p id="pp8"><strong>What about other websites?</strong></p>
<p>In  addition to the Sites, Ubisoft also owns several other domain names that may  provide links to the Sites. We may from time to time also offer new websites  that may or may not be Sites. Please note, however, that this policy applies  only to the Sites on  which this Privacy Statement is made available by Ubisoft and not to websites  maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may provide links. Please  note, however, that when you link to foreign sites or any other third party  sites from our Sites, this Privacy Policy no longer applies. Ubisoft does not  control the activities on those third party sites and &nbsp;cannot and does not guarantee the security of  any personal information disclosed on those third party sites. </p>
<p id="pp7"><strong>Does Ubisoft Use Cookies, Track IP Addresses or Use Other  Passive Means to Collect Information? </strong></p>
<p>Ubisoft  uses cookies on the Sites. A "cookie" is a small bit of  record-keeping information that web sites often store on a user's computer.  Cookies do not include people's names, e-mail addresses, or other information  that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a  user's computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit. For  example, Ubisoft uses cookies to keep track of selected items in your shopping  cart and to remember your login name and password. Any information collected this  way is held only up until midnight of the same day, at which point, the  information is deleted. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert  you when cookies are being sent to your computer, although this may affect your  ability to shop online. For more information about cookies, please see <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. </p>
<p>Ubisoft  also keep tracks of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for safety and security  reasons. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to  identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. </p>
<p>The  only other information passively collected by Ubisoft is in the form of logs -  files that record web site activity, including how many "hits" a  particular web page is getting (a.k.a. "click-through data"). This  information is used in an aggregated form and not to identify specific use  patterns of you or any individual. &nbsp;These  entries enable Ubisoft to assess overall site activity, track interest in  advertised sales, and troubleshoot technical concerns. We also use the log file  entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can  constantly improve the referral services we provide you. </p>
<p>Ubisoft  may collect information regarding the user’s behaviour, and his/her use of  Ubisoft’s demos and in-game data such as achievements, rankings, time played to  better adapt our products and services to users’ interests and for a better  quality of our services. </p>
<p id="pp9"><strong>Who is collecting my personal information and how will it  be used? </strong></p>
<p>The  information you submit to our Sites is collected and used by Ubisoft as set out  above. In addition, Ubisoft may use the submitted information to send you  advertising or promotional materials, including information about special  rebates, promotional offers and other events of interest in accordance with  your choices. We also use your personal information for our internal marketing  and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services  we provide you and to better meet your needs. </p>
<p>From  time to time, Ubisoft may employ third-party vendors, to collect personal  information on Ubisoft's behalf. These third parties provide internal support  to Ubisoft by operating some of the services we provide you including free  email services and online product fulfillment. If we solicit third parties to  collect personal information on our behalf, we require all such third  parties&nbsp; to comply with and adhere to this  Privacy Statement. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply  your name, billing and mailing addresses, email address, credit card number and  valid expiration date. Although these third-party vendors, not Ubisoft, collect  the personal information you provide when requesting such services, they do not  share your personal information with third parties. In addition, Ubisoft has  access to all information a third party collects on Ubisoft's behalf. </p>
<p>If  you use our Sites from outside Canada, please be aware that your personal information may be transferred to, stored in, and processed  in Canada. The data protection and other laws of Canada have been recognised as  providing an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European  Commission. If you are transferring your personal data from the United Kingdom,  please be assured that in processing any personal information in Canada,  Ubisoft complies with these laws.&nbsp; </p>
<p id="pp10"><strong>With whom does Ubisoft share my personal information? </strong></p>
<p>Ubisoft  may share your personal information among the Ubisoft group of companies.&nbsp; This sharing enables us to provide you with  information about products and services, which might interest you. To the  extent that our corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will  follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in  this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>From  time to time, we may share your personal information with technical partners  which help Ubisoft with the operation of the Services, including, without  limitation, payment processing, and products delivery. To the extent that our technical  partners have access to your information, they will follow practices that are  at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Statement. </p>
<p>From  time to time, we are approached by companies and organizations that provide  products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and we may  share your personal information with such third parties in accordance with your  choices. We strive to limit use of the information you provide to those offers  that we think you would appreciate receiving. If you do not wish to receive  information from these third party partners, you can opt out at the time of  information collection (i.e., when you fill out the product registration form). </p>
<p>Should  you decide to link your Ubisoft Account to your console manufacturer gaming  account Ubisoft will only exchange information regarding your age, country,  date of birth and email with such parties. No other personal information such  as your credit card information or address will be exchanged with such parties. </p>
<p id="pp11"><strong>Can I choose how my personal information is used? </strong></p>
<p>If  you do not want Ubisoft to send you communications about special rebates or  promotional offers, you may opt-out from receiving these communications at the  time your personal information is collected or by contacting us by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>fax  at 01932 578001</li>
  <li>post  at Ubisoft Ltd, 1st Floor, Chertsey Gate East, London Street, Chertsey, Surrey,  KT16 8AP, United Kingdom.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, along with every communication  sent to you, Ubisoft gives you the opportunity to discontinue receiving future  communications. </p>
<p id="pp12"><strong>How do I access my personal information? </strong></p>
<p>If  for any reason you wish to question, view, correct or delete the personal  information collected about you by Ubisoft, please send an email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@ubisoft.co.uk" target="_blank"><strong>webmaster@ubisoft.co.uk</strong></a> or write to Ubisoft Ltd, 1st Floor, Chertsey Gate East, London Street,  Chertsey, Surrey, KT16 8AP, United Kingdom. We will be happy to review, update  or remove information as appropriate. However, we may still retain information  in our files to resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, due to technical or  legal requirements or matters related to security, integrity or operation of  our Sites. </p>
<p id="pp13"><strong>Does Ubisoft Collect Personal Information from Children  Under 12? </strong></p>
<p>Ubisoft  encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children. We  urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names,  addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet. We  recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from  young children. Therefore, in order for children under 12 years old to register  on any Site, , we require that the child provides the email address of a parent  or guardian who will be contacted by Ubisoft in order to confirm, modify or  refuse his or her child’s registration. Ubisoft reserves the right to request  written proof of the parent or guardian’s authorization at any time. If the  parent or guardian does not answer within 30 days of Ubisoft’s email, the  child’s personal information will be deleted and his or her registration  refused.”</p>
<p id="pp14"><strong>What Safeguards Does Ubisoft Use to Protect My Personal  Information? </strong></p>
<p>We  take your privacy and the security of your personal information very seriously.  We comply with the Data Protection Act 1998. To protect your personal  information, Ubisoft maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security,  integrity and privacy of the information you have provided. Our Sites have security  measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information  under our control. Personal information collected by Ubisoft is stored in  secure operating environments that are not available to the public (e.g.,  locked rooms). To prevent unauthorized electronic access to personal  information, Ubisoft maintains information collected online behind a  firewall-protected server and uses SSH encryption. </p>
<p>In  addition, we take reasonable steps to assure that third parties who collect  personal information on our behalf provide sufficient protection of personal  information in addition to requiring their compliance with this Privacy  Statement at all times. </p>

<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to Might &amp; Magic: Duel of Champions (aka DoC), and thank you for joining us on this amazing adventure!</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to create interesting and powerful decks to battle against challengers from all over the world.</p>
<p>Read on to discover some useful tips and strategies to get you started ...</p>
<h1>1/ How to build a deck?</h1>
<p><b>The ideal deck is composed of 59 cards:</b></p>
<ul><li>1 Hero</li></ul>
<ul><li>8 Events</li></ul>
<ul><li>50 Other cards (A mix of creatures, spells, fortunes or buildings depending on your preference)</li></ul>
<p>You can create decks with up to 209 cards in them, but keep in mind that each card you add means there is less chance you will draw the cards you want during a duel.</p>
<p>A good guide when starting off in DoC is to have more creatures than spells or fortunes in your deck until you know how different cards work. Bigger, more costly cards aren't always better : sometimes having lots of small creatures can help you get an early and decisive advantage over your opponent. Choose your cards wisely!</p>
<p><b>Your Hero determines the deck you will build.</b></p>
<p>Each hero in the game has a <b>faction</b>, which determines the creature &amp; fortune cards that you can put into their deck.</p>
<p>There are seven factions in the game - Haven, Necropolis, Inferno, Stronghold, Sanctuary, Academy, and a Neutral faction.</p>
<p>For example, the hero Seria, Seeker of the Lost Souls, is from the Nercopolis faction so you can only add Necropolis or Neutral creatures and fortunes to her deck.</p>
<p>Heroes also have knowledge of one or more <b>spell schools</b>, which determine the spell cards you can use in their deck. Seria can only use Dark and Water spells.</p>
<p>There are many different types of decks and strategies. Once you think you have understood how most the cards work, try checking out some of the decks in the forums.</p>
<h1>2/ What to buy in the shop?</h1>
<p>This will vary according to most people's preference, but here is possibly the easiest way for starting off in the game.</p>
<p><b>Do the tutorial then finish the campaign!</b> This will give you a good amount of starting gold and seals.</p>
<p>After that, go fight a few duels against other players to reach the next level, and, once you have enough seals, buy the Box (or the Serious Box if you can). This will give you loads of cards and should enable you to start rising up the ranks.</p>
<p>Only buy Heroic Packs if you think you have enough creatures: if you buy a Heroic Pack too soon, you could get a hero from a different faction that you can't use yet as you don't have enough cards of that faction.</p>
<p>Only buy consumables (XP and gold boosts) if you know what you are doing.</p>
<p>Buying Swiss Tournament tickets early on may also be counter-productive.</p>
<p>Again, these are just recommended strategies for new players.</p>
<h1>3/ What are the game modes?</h1>
<p>When you click the <b>Play</b> button at the top of the screen you will be taken to the <b>Classic Duel</b>, which pairs you up against other players of your skill level (ELO) for straight forward duels. This is where you will get your constant flow of gold and experience points.</p>
<p>The Tournament button will take you to the different tournament modes. Depending on what day it is, the official tournament will either be a <b>Jackpot Tournament</b> or a <b>Swiss Tournament</b>.</p>
<p>The Jackpot Tournament will allow you to fight against other players one by one: you start off with 0 points and gradually work your way up the leaderboard if you can. You gain less gold for each duel as most of it is put into the global Jackpot. The higher up the leaderboard you go, the higher the percentage of the jackpot you will win at the end of the day!</p>
<p>The Swiss Tournament will allow you to enter an 8 player group. You will then fight 3 duels, and the best 2 players will get a nice prize. There will also be a lucky prize given to one of the players who comes 3rd to 8th place. To enter a Swiss tournament you need Tickets that can be bought in the shop. You can also create your own <b>Custom Tournaments</b> if you want to practice the Swiss Tournament, but these have no rewards.</p>
<p><b>The tournaments do not unlock until you reach 200 ELO</b>, but in general, we would advise you NOT to enter tournaments until you feel confident you know the game well, as you may face some very experienced players!</p>
<h1>4/ What is the Infernal Pit?</h1>
<p>You can use the Infernal Pit to burn cards you don't want for gold. The size of your sacrifice also gives you a chance to win the Infernal Card Deal on offer. The cards you burn <b>will be gone forever</b> (or until you find new ones in packs)... so don't rush into this.</p>
<p>The special card on offer changes randomly every 8 hours.</p>
<p>The Infernal Pit can be found in the top menu, but it only <b>unlocks after you reach level 5.</b></p>
<h1>5/ What is the Altar of Wishes?</h1>
<p>You can use the Altar of Wishes to get specific cards you want. Just drag the desired card onto the Altar, pay its Wildcard cost, and the card is yours. You can get Wildcards from packs and boxes you buy from the Shop.</p>
<p>The Altar of Wishes can be found in the top menu, but it only <b>unlocks after you get your first Wildcard.</b></p>
<h1>6/ Where to get more information? </h1>
<p>Take a look at the different sections of the help manual to learn more about the cards and the rules of the battleground.</p>
<p>If you want more information about strategy and general topics, don't forget to check the official forums, the Facebook page, and the Twitter feed!</p>

<h1>Object of the Game</h1>
<p>The objective of the game is to bring your opponent's hero’s life to zero before your hero is defeated. To achieve this goal, you will be deploying Creatures and Buildings, casting Spells and taking advantage of Fortunes and Events.</p>
<h1>User Interface Control</h1>
<p><ul>
 <li>Cards that you can interact with, either in your hand or on the battleground, are always highlighted by a green halo. Just left-click (tap on iPad) on them to use them.</li>
 <li>You can always right-click (double tap on iPad) on a card to zoom in on it and read all the details.</li>
 <li>You can cancel most actions by right-clicking (tapping on iPad) anywhere.</li>
 <li>Click (tap on iPad) on the End Turn button, located at the top of the screen, when you’re done with your turn.</li>
</ul></p>
<h1>Icons</h1>

</tr></table>
<h1>Cards in Hand</h1>
<p>When the match begins, each player draws 6 cards. Each of those cards has a cost in resources (<img src="/Content/Shared/img_ressource_small.png" alt="" align="top"/>) in the upper left corner. Each card also has a requirement Level in Might (<img src="/Content/Shared/img_might_s.png" alt="" align="top"/>) , Magic (<img src="/Content/Shared/img_magic_s.png" alt="" align="top"/>) and/or Destiny (<img src="/Content/Shared/img_destiny_s.png" alt="" align="top"/>) before being usable. Creatures normally have a requirement in <img src="/Content/Shared/img_might_s.png" alt="" align="top"/>, Spells in <img src="/Content/Shared/img_magic_s.png" alt="" align="top"/> and Fortunes in <img src="/Content/Shared/img_destiny_s.png" alt="" align="top"/>.</p>
<h1>Hero</h1>
<p>Your hero can perform one action each of your turns. Generally, the list of possible actions for a hero is:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Increase the level of <img src="/Content/Shared/img_might_s.png" align="top"/>, <img src="/Content/Shared/img_magic_s.png" align="top"/> or <img src="/Content/Shared/img_destiny_s.png" align="top"/> by one.</li>
 <li>Draw a card.</li> <li>Use his/her special ability.</li>
 </ul>
<h1>Resources</h1>
<p>Each turn, your resources production will increase by one: on the first turn you’ll have one resource, two on the second, three on the third, etc… The more the game progresses, the more resources you have to use more powerful cards, or use more cards in the same turn.</p>
<p>The player who starts second produces 2 resources on their first turn.</p>

<h1>Supply Phase</h1>
<p>In this phase, before anything else occurs, those four steps are done automatically:
<ul>
<li>Empty resources: Your current resources are set to 0.</li>
<li>Increase production: Your resources production is increased by one.</li>
<li>Produce resources: Your resources production total is added to your current resources.</li>
<li>Draw: Draw a new card from your library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anytime that you have to draw a card and your library is out of cards, you lose one life for each card missing.</p>
<h1>Action Phase</h1>
<p>You can do any number of the following actions, in the order you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every Creature that was already there at the start of your turn can either attack or move, once.</li>
<li>You can play any number of cards from your hand, of which you fulfill the requirement level in <img src="/Content/Shared/img_might_s.png" alt="" align="top"/>, <img src="/Content/Shared/img_magic_s.png" alt="" align="top"/> and <img src="/Content/Shared/img_destiny_s.png" alt="" align="top"/>, by paying their cost in <img class="icon_img" src="/Content/Shared/img_ressource_small.png" alt="" align="top"/>.</li>
<li>You can use each Event card once, paying its activation cost if any.</li>
<li>You can use your hero once.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the current player finishes their Action phase, their turn is over. The other player becomes the current player and follows the same phases.</p>

section/battlegrounds/content

ME_WEB_HELP_00001
------
<h1>Line vs. Row</h1>
<p>The Battleground contains 16 positions where creatures and buildings can be deployed. Each player has two vertical lines called the back line and the front line, made up of four horizontal rows, making for a total of 8 battleground positions for each player to place their creatures and buildings.</p>
<h1>Creature Types and Deployment Rules</h1>
<p>Melee creatures can only be deployed on the Front Line. Shooter creatures can only be deployed on the Back Line. Flyers can be deployed on either Line. Creatures that are melee and shooter at the same time can also be deployed on either line.</p>
<h1>Buildings Placement</h1>
<p>Building can be placed on any battleground position you control. You cannot have more than one building at any location, but you can have a creature and building at the same location.</p>
<h1>Event Cards</h1>
<p>Each player brings eight Event cards to the match. Those sixteen Events are shuffled together and the first two are placed on the battleground. At the end of each turn, the leftmost event is removed from the battleground, the rightmost is moved in its place and a new one is drawn to replace it. When the Events deck is empty and a new one needs to be drawn, they are re-shuffled. A player may use each of the two currently available Events each turn, no matter who brought them, even if the opponent has already used the Event during their turn. Choose your Events wisely though - they can help your opponent too.</p>

------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00044

------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00045

At the Gorge of the Wolf, the company once again has to face Griffin troops, this time led by Archangel Sandalphon. The Windswords then continue and cross Wyvern Pass.
------
C1M3E3_Summary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00046
------
Now in Orc territory, the Windswords survive an ambush set by Usun, champion of the Blackskull, and finally arrive at the foot of Mount Aghula-Yasu.
------
C1M3E4_Summary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00047
------
The Windswords confront Kassar, the supreme leader of the Blackskull. He mentions the blood of Urgash, another name for the dragonblood crystals linked with Chaos magic. Could these crystals be on Mount Aghula-Yasu?...
------
C1M4E1_Summary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00048
------
At the top of Mount Aghula-Yasu there is no sign of the Chaos crystals, however there is a rare and ancient relic - the Pillar of Lights. Looking into in, the Windswords learn that the answers to their questions are to be found in the monastery at Helexia. Ga'arend takes them there.
------
C1M4E2_Summary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00049
------
Before the gate of the monastery at Helexia, the Windswords once again meet Lyria, the demonist they had fought on Mount Aghula-Yasu. The young girl requests their help in order to beat a rival. The Windswords accept.
------
C1M4E3_Summary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00050
------
By studying the manuscripts kept in the scriptorium at Helexia, the mercenaries learn that their real foe is the Void, an ancient, primordial force. When they leave the monastery, the Windswords have to fight Sandalphon and the Griffin soldiers again. They then continue to the Halls of Amnesia.
------
C1M4E4_Summary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00051
------
As they near the Halls of Amnesia, the Windswords are attacked by Phrias, the Prince of Annihilation. Lyria help them to beat the Demon Lord and insists on accompanying the Company. Then Yukiko, a Naga who had been observing the Windswords from a distance, appears and invites them to follow her to Shanriya, the city of eternal snows, where a new challenge awaits them.
------
C1M5E1_Summary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00052
------
After the fight with the Naga champion, Yukiko reveals to the Windswords that their next adversary is a necromancer who has vowed allegiance to the Void - Ariana of the Severed Fates. She is hiding in the Moonsilk Cocoon.
------
C1M5E2_Summary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00053

------
C1M5E3_Summary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00054
------
The Windswords discover that Akane, the second Champion of the Void is actually the sister of their scribe, Sayuri. Shocked, Sayuri - who had remained silent up until then - speaks. The mercenaries barely have time to question Sayuri about the situation when Myranda finally locates the Dragonblood Nexus.
------
C1M5E4_Summary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00055
------
While passing under the base of the mountain that contains No-Shanriya, the Windswords are once again challenged by Kassar, who has miraculously survived his mortal wounding. Finally, they get to the cavern containing the blood of Urgash.
------
C1M5E5_Summary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00056
------
One last Champion of the Void blocks the way leading to the Throne of Renewal. The Windswords have faced this enemy that they know only too well - Kieran, their former captain. Finally the grand scheme of things is revealed…
------
C1M5E6_Summary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00099
------
The Herald of the Void refuses to accept his own demise - you must fight it to the end. The Windswords ready themselves to fight... and face death.
------
C1M0E1_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00075

Officer Vein will explain the tactics to you, but all training will come from your swordmaster... me! Now, let's see you crush that ghost!
------
C1M0E2_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00076

Another ghost. You've fought one before, so let me just say this - show no mercy!
------
C1M0E3_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00077

Banshees are insidious things, but you should be able to get rid of these without too much trouble. Got it, recruits?
------
C1M0E4_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00078
------
You should defeat this Banshee just as easily. Crush her!
------
C1M0E5_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00079
------
Ga'arend is going a little easy on you. His champion isn't very powerful, but if you wait too long to beat him, he will call upon stronger allies. No time to waste!
------
C1M0E6_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00080
------
This time, you will face a true army, albeit a small one. We just need to ensure that you've been listening to all I've told you. OK?!
------
C1M1E1_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00057

The Orcs pillaging Vradeck's Crossing are disorganised. They pose no real threat, as long as we hold position. Understood, soldiers?
------
C1M1E2_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00058
------
Crag Hack may have taken us by surprise, but his attacks are not very effective. Drive him towards the middle of the river. That will make it even harder for him to attack.
------
C1M1E3_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00059
------
These Orcs are tougher. They have several flying units and shamen in their ranks. Be vigilant - they can strike accurately from a distance.
------
C1M1E4_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00060

The Griffin troops are well organised and well-known for their strong defensive lines. We must break through this human wall if we are to move ahead.
------
C1M2E1_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00081

Soldiers, attack and retreat as quickly as you can. Vampires can drain your life force, even from a distance. Believe me, I know what I'm talking about...
------
C1M2E2_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00082
------
Fleshbane's army of incorporeal creatures will be hard to hit unless you bring your magic attackers to the front lines for this battle.
------
C1M2E3_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00083
------
Soldiers, keep your distance. The Undeads' attacks are poisonous. If they scratch you, they will penetrate your armour... You will be infected and die a slow and painful death...
------
C1M2E4_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00084
------
Shaar's capacity for attacks is truly formidable. We must attack her and prevent her army from regrouping, growing, and overwhelming us.
------
C1M3E1_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00085
------
Watch the skies for Sandalphon's soldiers. They will be coming for us. Beware their magic - it can strike multiple ranks at once.
------
C1M3E2_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00086

Usun's rage is not to be forgotten. This Orc leader knows nothing of tactics but is ready to sacrifice his entire army to crush us.
------
C1M3E3_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00087

Kassar's anger is formidable. It flows through the veins of each of his warriors. Each Orc killed will enrage his brothers. They will fight to the death…
------
C1M3E4_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00088

The Abyssal Lord who serves this demonist, draws its power from flames and darkness. We must use our attack spells.

Sephilia is a demon, a master of fire spells. She can strike several areas at once.

Sandalphon descends from the skies with a celestial army of greater power than ever before. Comrades, mastering both air magic and the skies will be essential to this battle.

ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00091

Phrias will turn to fire magic. He will attack from behind and try to destroy or reserves with immense flames.

Takana's creatures fight with honor, but do not underestimate them. They are skilled and well-trained.

Time is against us. Ariana has the power to infect our ranks and even to draw energy from our soldiers to heal her own wounds...
------
C1M5E2_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00094
------
Akane is a tainted image of Sayuri. For her, honor is a superfluous limitation. Her treacherous spells can even reverse the passage of time.
------
C1M5E3_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00095
------
Kassar is consumed by rage. The horn on his forehead makes him impervious to magic, but also prevents him from using complex or elaborate spells.
------
C1M5E4_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00096
------
I know our old Captain's strategy well. First, he will reinforce his defence before launching a massive attack! We need to cut the ground from under his feet.
------
C1M5E5_OpponentSummary
------
ME_MAIN_CMP_C1OLD_GM1_00097

The Herald of the Void is a formidable adversary. I have never seen anything like this before, soldiers. It can summon forth creatures and spells of every faction...

Most desperate souls become Mercenaries for the gold or the glory. Join a good company with a good reputation and your fortune is made. But we are Windswords, sworn to Ylath, the Dragon-God of Air. We are brothers, bound by our oath, and by a past we all want to forget. 
I fled the halls of the Necromancers and the magical city of Al-Betyl. The day they gave me the Sacred Spider’s venom and turned me into a Vampire, my fate had been sealed. Though I tried for over a century, it was not a “life” for me. Yet, no matter how far I travel, the Dragons catch me. When the gods have you in their plans, there is nowhere to run.

It was just another typical gritty day in the life of a Windsword. Kieran, our company commander, announced our new marching orders. Apparently the Holy Emperor was no longer getting his favorite meads and meats from the Free Cities: entire caravans had been going missing for nearly a year. We had been hired to secure the trade route.
When we struck camp at Vradek’s Crossing, what we had been sent to find found us. A band of raging Orcs came charging up to our perimeter whilst most of our men still lay sleeping.
Orcs! Mistakenly treated as mindless brutes... Creations of the Wizards of the Seven Cities… Human captives infused with Demon blood in a series of successful experiments to create the perfect Demon Slayers. 
Finally… some excitement to chase away the boredom.

Orcs marauding on the frontiers of the Empire was nothing out of the ordinary. But Captain Ga’arend, an Orc himself, warned us that something was not quite right about our enemy. The discussion was cut short by the clamor of our alarms.
I had lived three centuries longer than anyone else in the company, and I thought nothing could surprise me anymore. I could not believe my eyes. A ragtag band of Pirates came pouncing into our camp with swords raised high. What were they doing here… in a wooded valley snuggled neatly between two mountains, a hundred leagues from the nearest ocean?

Our battle with the pirates ended in a truce. Their flamboyant captain introduced himself as Crag Hack. Ga’arend said he knew him by reputation. Judging from the excited gleam in his eyes, we had just crossed swords with a legend. 
Crag Hack was looking for missing treasure that had been stolen from his ships by Orc looters, and he had mistaken our camp for theirs. A simple explanation, but it failed to convince me. 
The next day we parted company. Crag Hack followed the Orcs. We resumed our own march through the woods.
The air grew icy and biting. At dusk we made camp, but our fires brought little comfort. Something cold and dark was hiding, watching us… waiting. 
Suddenly, a piercing wail shot through our camp setting all the men to shivers. I had heard that cry before. 
A Banshee!  Spirit of mourning, mistress of despair…

I tried to communicate with the Banshee before sending her off to the Spirit World, but she would not… or perhaps could not… answer me. As the rest of the company celebrated, I began wondering if I had not been away for far too long from Al-Betyl and my fellow Necromancers. 
The next day, we found an Orc camp. They were different. Darker of skin, their bodies horribly twisted by Chaos magic. Their leader introduced herself as Shaar, great shaman of the Blackskull Clan. She offered to read the future of her people in our bleached and dried bones. We politely declined her invitation, and violence ensued…

Shaar left the battlefield with fury in her eyes and a promise of vengeance. Commander Kieran called us apart to voice his concerns. The region was infested with more than simple brigands. We needed to go back to our client and report. 
Captain Ga’arend was certain that the powers of Chaos were the cause of Shaar’s madness. His suspicions proved right when we found a Demon Lord the very next day, hissing and shouting orders to his legions. It was useless to ask him about the motives of his presence here. All we could do was destroy his material body and banish him back to the hells of Sheogh.

You shouldn’t have any problems dispatching this Orc. He can surprise you with some creatures with “Quick Attack” and defend himself with Stone Skin. If you plan for a longer game, it should be easy.

This is your first real challenge. Necro creatures are usually harder to kill; most of the ones you’ll face have immunity to retaliation or Incorporeal. If you want to prevail, pack in multiple ways to deal damage to take care of each threat in one shot.

This is a fairly slow opponent, but it will punish you if you let it live too long. The deck is packed with high cost spells that are meant to take control of the board. Stack this with a few creatures with “Attack Anywhere” and you understand why you don’t want this fight to drag for too long.

Garant uses a sneaky tactic; he will try to force damage through to your hero using Hall of Torment, lots of them. Make sure you’re ready to play whatever he asks for. Creature-wise, his deck is filled with “Sweep Attack” and “Area Blast”. Be mindful of your deployment pattern and you should be fine.

We returned to Denstadt to report to our employer, none other than Siegfried Brightblade, Field Marshal of the Holy Empire. He weighed our words a dozen times before deciding to believe them. He then admitted that while we were battling Chaos deformed Orcs and wandering Demons in the forest, other attacks had been reported this side of the border. 
The problem closest to home was just under our feet in the city catacombs. The city guard had gone down days ago and not a soul had returned. The Field Marshal signed us up for another fortnight, and asked us to swear by the Dragons to make whatever evil was lurking in the shadows disappear.

We entered the catacombs below Denstadt. The air was thick with green dust. Breathing was difficult, and among the chilling piles of bones and skulls, we discovered a nightmarish vision… 
Soldiers lying on the ground, bodies twisted into abominable shapes, skin scorched black, eyes rolled back in their heads, green foam dribbling from their lips…
Standing above them, perched on a pretentious throne carried by Ghouls, was the familiar face of Al-Betyl’s renowned alchemist and specialist in all things poison.
“Nergal, my old friend. Where have you been?” I shouted. “How many times must I kill you?”

There was nothing left of the city guard we were sent to find. Nergal had poisoned most of them, and enlisted their bodies into the ranks of his Undead. I killed the last man myself. Still, Kieran thought it best we investigate the extent of the underground network in the hopes someone had escaped.
The catacombs gave way to an immense cavern complex. We finally came upon a large expanse and were greeted by Farhang. The last time I saw him in Al Betyl, he had not yet been turned into a Vampire. He was a very ambitious Death Knight. He did not seem to remember me. Or perhaps he did… He ordered his minions to put my head on a spear.

Death is full of surprises.
We followed the tunnels for a good hour, and finally emerged dead in the heart of a vast cemetery, a league away from Denstadt. It was filled with angry ghosts, led by a monstrous form, part-human, part-spider. I knew him as Fleshbane, the Misshapen. 
When we take the sacred venom of the Spider Queen to become Vampires, and hold our breaths that last instant before the breathlessness of eternity, we are never really sure of the outcome. Most of us do not survive the ordeal. Some seem untouched on the outside, locked in the beauty of their youth, but are broken on the inside, their souls torn and twisted. 
For Fleshbane, it was the opposite. He kept his wits, but his body was ravaged, deformed. He became a renegade, and another name on my list when I was still known as the Reaper, executioner of Al-Betyl…

We cleared the cemetery of the restless dead, though a great many escaped, including Fleshbane. We then headed back to report to Brightblade that the Necromancers were a renegade group. Al-Betyl, a prominent capitol amongst the constellation of the Seven Cities, would never conspire against the Holy Empire. 
But before we could reach the gates of Denstadt, it was he who rode out to us. The Blackskull Orc Shaman, Shaar, was moving fast and hard on the city with a large army. Apparently she was still after our bones. 
Captain Ga’arend went out to meet her. They spoke for a long moment, but when he returned, I could see on his face that we had no choice but to let Fate decide which bones the vultures would scatter to the four winds…

Shaar’s spirit had passed on to meet her ancestors, and Ga’arend was troubled and silent. He knew that more Orcs would die, as we tracked the fleeing survivors of the Blackskull clan back to their home. Whatever source had corrupted their bodies and minds had to be found and destroyed.
After several days of difficult progress on craggy, twisting paths, we entered the macabre heart of Blackskull territory… Skulls adorning spears for miles on end. Enough to fill the catacombs of Al-Betyl.
We expected to find more Orcs, or Demons, but not a Naga Wizard. Our second in command, Myranda, herself from the Seven Cities, recognized the stranger as Akane, an influential counsellor to the rulers of the Archmage Council.
Whatever her mission, she apparently did not want us to be able to divulge her presence to anyone. We were attacked in short order…

Your first encounter with Sanctuary will be a rather strange one. Akane uses Nether Curse to force you to empty your graveyard or to damage you directly. Otherwise, she can slow you down with Immobilize, Frozen Touch and Outmanoeuvre, with a little help from some threat removal. Her army is well rounded, but effectively slow to get in gears.

Akane bowed in defeat before our Commander in formal Naga fashion but her attitude was all but humble. Deep within her eyes boiled an absent, albeit determined, forlorn stare. I had seen that particularly devious form of resolve once before. It was a sickness I had thought beaten and banished… and now it had returned.
Myranda moved to wipe off Akane’s arrogant look with the back of her sword, but Kieran intervened. He asked Akane the one question burning on all of our minds. “In the name of all the Dragons… why?”
“You are all fools, trapped in your superstitions and beliefs. The Herald of the Void has come, and she shall free us all! While you were fighting me, she has restored the throne!”
Akane’s taunt brought looks of confusion to everyone but myself. I understood far too well what evil stood before us. 
Then, in a blur, Akane jumped, grasping Kieran’s shoulder, and both of them disappeared in a dark vortex that sucked away the light…

Desperate for answers and a clue as to where Akane had taken Kieran, Myranda had us search the area. We quickly discovered a pulsing cluster of Dragonblood Crystals. These were the blood of a Dragon God, spilled during the Wars of Creation, solidified over centuries. Pure, concentrated magic… 
These particular crystals were shifting in shape and color, radiating corruption. Chaos crystals, the blood of Urgash, father of all Demons… Now I understood the origin of the Blackskull Orcs’ horrible mutations.
We were not the only ones drawn to this incredible source of power. A Necromancer appeared behind us and called out to me.
“Vein! Filthy renegade! You were Archon Belketh’s Reaper, our lawful executioner. How dare you desecrate our laws and pact with Demons?!”

I stopped Myranda from slaying our defeated captive. His name was Adar-Malik. He and I had never shared anything but a mutual hatred for one another, but he had also been a student of my mentor, Archon Belketh, and had replaced me as his Reaper. 
Belketh had sent him to rout out the rebellious Necromancers we fought in Denstadt’s catacombs. He had learned from his spies that I was seen with a mercenary army near the infested city, and had mistakenly assumed that I was the leader of the renegade circle.
Our friendly chat was interrupted by a Naga warrior, swords drawn, who seemed to materialize from the shadows.
“I lay my eyes on you for the first time, strangers… To be precise, it is the second time for one of you.
I have been observing you for a while. Your battle with Akane, my forlorn sister, was impressive, but her mistress will be a tougher opponent. As we speak she is gathering forces.
You must now prove yourselves worthy of such an adversary.”

Noboru bowed before us, much as Akane had earlier that day, but the smile on his face was anything but disrespectful. His challenge had been a test. He was on our side. He needed allies, but only those he thought could stand a chance against the so-called Herald of the Void.
He gave us the true name of our enemy: the Wizard Gazal, Akane’s mistress, head of house Anima, Archmage of the Seven Cities. He then confirmed my suspicions. Gazal had been exposed to the Void, a boundless, primordial force, the oldest known to Ashan. The beginning and the end of all things, even the Dragon Gods.
Gazal’s powers now fed off the Void, and those who fought against her would risk not only death, but being erased from the very fabric of Creation.
Adar-Malik gave me a glaring look, but this time his hatred was not directed at me. We both knew the danger of the Void. We both bore its scars.
Suddenly, Myranda drew her sword and shouted out:
“A Succubus spy! Seize her!”

It took all of our combined efforts to bind down the Succubus with magical chains. Myranda recognized her from her days in the Seven Cities, and the revelation hit her like a knife in the back. 
With a strained voice, she explained to us that under a human face, this Dhamiria had been a servant in the palace of the Wizard Hakeem, head of house Chimera and esteemed member of the Council of Nine. 
Hakeem was a noted political ally of Gazal, but more importantly, he had been Myranda’s former lover…
Myranda had strong reasons to believe Hakeem would lead us to Gazal, Akane, and hopefully Kieran. With our consent, and the help of all our spell casters, she used the Succubus’s link to her master to pinpoint his location.
In an instant, the entire company teleported in front of Hakeem’s hideout. Beastman servants immediately raised the alarm and then charged.

The great Wizard Hakeem wept as he begged Myranda for forgiveness. It was not for fear of death, but merely shame. He admitted he had plotted with Gazal and other ambitious Wizards to obtain control of the Seven Cities.
A powerful Necromancer named Sandro was the original leader of their cabal. He brought them an ancient artifact called the Throne of Renewal. Gazal was the first to sit upon it, and something went wrong. She became possessed by the Void. Hakeem barely escaped with his life, and realizing what they had done, was determined to surrender himself to the Circle of the Nine and warn them of the danger.
Sandro! Belketh’s most promising disciple… A name that still burned slowly within my soul, hotter than the Sacred Spider’s venom flowing in my veins. But it was not Sandro who suddenly burst in on our meeting. It was another old friend… Kieran, our commander, wearing that absent look in his eyes. And, we, his former Windsword brothers, were now simply enemy strangers to be slaughtered.

I had fought with Kieran for over a decade, and he may have been a lot of things, but a traitor he was not. The Void had perverted him and converted him to the Herald’s cause. Before we could capture him, a dark vortex similar to the one used by Akane gobbled him away.
I pressed Hakeem to give us more details about Sandro and the Throne of Renewal. He told me that it was the Necromancer Ariana who had introduced Sandro to Gazal. I knew Ariana well. She was one of Sandro’s followers, and, like her master, had been banished from Al Betyl for acts of Nethermancy, dark magic involving the forbidden power of the Void.
Gazal had offered sanctuary to Ariana and Sandro in her secret hideaway. She called it Mir-Al-Din. It was a place of great power, consisting of five magical and elusive towers, hidden deep in the Sahaar desert since the ancient ages.  Gazal had found and kept for herself the legendary Mir-Al-Din. 
Hakeem could not lead us there, but he knew someone who could…

We entered the Sahaar desert in marching order. Hakeem said we had a long journey ahead of us. He continued his story…
The origin of the Throne of Renewal was obscure, but it clearly dated back to the ancient Shantiri civilization, like the towers of Mir-Al-Din. According to Sandro, it was imbued with a cleverly controlled form of Void magic and its purpose was to strengthen willpower by ridding the mind of all doubt and fear.
Gazal agreed to help Sandro, in exchange for the privilege of being the first to use the artifact. Sandro kept his word, but when Gazal sat upon the throne, a swirling vortex of pulsing darkness formed around her, like a cloak of nothingness.
Hakeem’s story was regretfully interrupted as our scouts reported a contingent of Crusaders coming our way. Ga’arend and I prepared our troops for a fight. The knight-templars of the Holy Empire had little tolerance for Orcs riding with Necromancers.

There was something oddly familiar with the Crusader Captain’s face, but I could not place him. These men were simple border patrol. They were an avant-garde escort for a comely young man, sumptuously dressed in the courtly fashion of the Lotus Empire. 
His personal guard was composed of Sayamas, Dune Nagas. How odd to see the snake-people of Shalassa, Dragon-Goddess of Water, claiming a part of the Sahaar desert as their own. They charged us, slithering through the sand in a fury, as if swimming through the waves of their native Jade Sea.

Myranda recognized the Naga leader as Shalan, ambassador of the Eternal Empress in the Seven Cities. She called out to him and was finally able to clear the misunderstanding and stop the mindless fighting. After some apologies on both sides, we shared tea and stories. 
Hakeem’s testimony managed to convince the Sayama Nagas and the Crusaders of the seriousness of Gazal’s threat and emissaries were immediately sent to inform their respective leaders.
We then parted ways. A Sayama scout led us to the nearest oasis for the night. 
But a group of Desert Orcs had already established camp. Their Shaman came to us with peace greetings. But suddenly, she saw Hakeem and her smile turned to a heinous scowl. 
In the time for a Cyclops to wink his deadly eye… we were surrounded by enraged Orc warriors.

Strangely enough, Zouleika, the Orc Shaman was neither Orc nor Shaman. She was a Human Wizard from House Chimera. She had abandoned the Seven Cities to live with the Orcs because she despised the way the leaders of her House, Hakeem first among them, exploited and abused their “creations”, the Orcs and the Beastmen.
Ga’arend managed to convince Zouleika to at least listen to Hakeem’s story. She spat, gritted her teeth and glared, but heard enough to come to the conclusion that Gazal was also a threat for the desert Orcs. She promised to gather the tribes.
The next day, we resumed our march. By nightfall, the dunes had given way to twisted rocky crags. Hakeem told us this is where we would find Ignatius, an Incubus, also part of Sandro’s conspiracy. But like Hakeem, he had refused to bow to the Void-corrupted Gazal.
Hakeem had just started to warn us that Ignatius was slightly paranoid, when the ground exploded under our feet, and Demons erupted within striking distance...

Finally calmed and restrained by Hakeem, Ignatius explained to us that he had not chosen to follow Chaos. His soul had been sold at an early age by his own mother to Phrias, a powerful Arch-Demon.
His pact with Sandro and Gazal had only one goal: to sever the cursed bond that chained him to Phrias. In a completely unexpected way, the deal had worked. After the events at Mir-Al-Din, he no longer sensed Phrias’s hold.
Ignatius completed Hakeem’s tale. When Gazal rose from the throne and proclaimed herself the Herald of the Void, Sandro realized his plan had gone awry. He tried to kill Gazal with a blighting death spell. She simply absorbed its power and seemed to grow stronger because of it.
Ariana immediately bowed to Gazal. Knowing Sandro, she would not be forgiven for such a betrayal. 
Just before fleeing, Sandro shattered the Throne of Renewal, opening up a gaping rift. Out of it poured horrifying Void-touched spirits.
As if to illustrate his story, suddenly an army of them attacked us.

This is a tricky fight. Shalan will try to use Truce and Sinkhole to gain card advantage and board advantage, but he needs to get up to 4 Might and 3 Destiny for his strategy to kick in. When he gets there, the creatures he bounces to his hand are cheaper to play, diminishing or even nullifying the drawback of some of his best cards. He uses Honor Binds Us as a finisher so watch out for surprise boosts.

The armies of Ashan gather before the towers of Mir-Al-Din, a hundred heroes are their heads. Every Dragon God is represented. The immense twirling storm cloud, manifestation of the Void-born rift, has called them here. Its power can be seen for a hundred miles… its presage of doom can be felt a thousand leagues in every direction. 
This enemy we face on the sands of the Sahaar owes her powers to Sandro, a man I once considered my friend, but whom I should have destroyed when I had the chance.
I am Vein, formerly Death Lord of House Eterna, and Belketh’s Reaper. Today, I am a simple Mercenary Captain, but I have been elected by my Windsword brothers to lead them in this war. I am their immortal commander, even though this may well be our final hour.

The attack of the Wraiths on our camp signaled to us all that there was no reason to avoid marching on the five towers of Mir-Al-Din any longer. Gazal knew we were here. She would keep sending her unnatural armies to test our strengths and bare our weaknesses. 
The Holy Empire was sending forces over the border to join with the construct armies of the Wizards and the Undead legions of Al-Betyl. But they would not arrive for weeks. I doubted the world could wait that long. Gazal was growing in power and had to be stopped. 
As we caught glimpse of the twirling rift in the distance, we were greeted by a familiar silhouette.
Ariana of the Severed Fates… Sandro’s most accomplished acolyte, and now Gazal’s pawn. She remained still and silent, as a dark and dangerous power coursed beneath her glowing skin.

Ariana fled to only the Dragons knew where. If she had truly betrayed Sandro to join Gazal, there would be nowhere to hide. Sandro would find her and make her pay for her insolence. Her fate was now tied to that of Gazal, whom I had every intention of destroying. 
Hakeem explained that in front of us, stood the Tower of the Smith, a monument of Shantiri craftsmanship and elegance, the first of the five towers. Its builders had dedicated it to Arkath, the Dragon God of Fire. I could swear that some of the stones were molten and alive.
Atop the tower, the Arch-Demon Phrias bellowed out orders to his minions. Ignatius stared at his former master, his jaws clenched in grim determination. The Void magic had somehow severed Ignatius’s bound to Phrias, and he was now free to seek revenge.

Ah… Akane. The Naga Wizard that stole our commander Kieran away.
She had safely tucked herself away within the tower built in honor of Shalassa, the Dragon Goddess of Water. How fitting a place for a Naga to defend!
The Sayamas were greatly moved, and told me that this was the Tower of the Dreamer, that had been described countless times by their artists, priests and soothsayers. It was a place of meditation and prayer they could visit in the Spirit World in time of need. Now they could see its physical manifestation with their very own eyes.
We could not let a Nethermancer control such a powerful edifice. Akane had abandoned her Dragon. And, now, she would suffer alone.

The fourth tower, called Tower of the Inventor, was dedicated to Ylath, the Dragon God of Air. Before it stood our Commander Kieran. I could see in his eyes that he no longer remembered who we were. 
Kieran asked us to bow low before the Herald of the Void, or he, the Knight of Negation, would sever our threads from the lying fabric of the Dragons.
I put my hand softly on Myranda’s shoulder and bid her to make ready the men. We would attack in unison with the Orc tribes of the Sahaar behind us. 
Kieran, like me, had not chosen his taint. It had been forced upon him, and like me, he would suffer its consequences. His fate now belonged to the Void, and mine was to destroy him.

Gazal had chosen the most powerful pinnacle for herself. The hovering Twilight Tower, dedicated to the Elder Dragons, Elrath and Malassa, Light and Darkness. From it Gazal could see the entire world of Ashan, and atop it, when her power would become great enough to eclipse the All and Everything, she might rule or destroy us all.
Hakeem and Ignatius explained to me that the Void rift grew up from the tower’s highest point, and Gazal was channeling its energy to create a shield of such power that all who touched it risked becoming plucked from the web of destiny. 
I simply asked them to provide us enough magical protection so that I might manoeuver our armies to confront Gazal’s elite guard. Once her army destroyed, we would find a way to fly up and rout her from the tower.

Her only flaw is that she doesn’t have any creatures that cost less than 3 resources, which gives you 2 turns to take the board before she crushes you.

<p>When you deploy a creature card with Stackable on top of another creature with the same name, you increase the size of that stack. That card goes to the graveyard as you keep only the original one on the battleground.

<p>The attack, retaliation and health values of a stack are equal to the values of the base creature multiplied by the stack size. When the amount of damage done to a stack is equal to the health of the base creature, the stack size is reduced by one. The left over damage is added to the stack, so if a spell deals a lot of damage, it can decrease the stack size by more than 1.

<p>Rule wise, a stack is considered one creature, whatever its size, so a spell like Town Portal will remove the entire stack from the battleground and send back only one copy of the creature to its owner’s hand. Likewise, a spell like Soulreaver that destroys one target creature will destroy an entire stack.

<p>Academy is the ideal faction for those who likes high risk high reward gameplay. Most of the creatures in Academy have high requirements or drawbacks you have to play around. If you succeed though, the game is yours. 
The mages are also pretty strong at supporting spell-based decks. Deploy some Magic Channel creatures and defend yourself with Spell Resist.

<p>The Wizards of the Seven Cities saved Ashan from a Demon invasion when they created the Orcs during the first Blood Moon eclipse. When the Orcs rebelled, taking many other Beastmen with them, the powers that rule were realigned and currently four houses manoeuver for power. Chimera, the creators of the beastmen, and Anima, the masters of Elemental spirits, are losing ground to House Materia, the creators of Golems and Titans. House Eterna has nearly split away with their Necromancers and Undead armies who some consider no longer Wizards.

ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00001
------
Long have I awaited your arrival... The time has come for you to challenge the legions of Ashan. But first, you must learn the tricks of the trade. Your first objective will be to destroy some ghouls with the help of my hand.
------
Tut_M01_Inst01
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00002
------
Let me teach you about the rules of battle. During the Action phase, each creature under your command can perform an action.
------
Tut_M01_Inst01_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00003
------
Use one of your Air Elementals to attack one of the ghouls.
------
Tut_M01_Inst02
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00004
------
Well done. Notice the 3 on the Air Elemental?
------
Tut_M01_Inst02_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00005
------
This value represents how much damage this creature does when it attacks.
------
Tut_M01_Inst02_2
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00006
------
The number in the red circle represents the remaining Health a creature has left - for example the ghoul has 2.
------
Tut_M01_Inst02_3
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00007
------
When the damage taken by a creature equals or exceeds its remaining Health, the creature dies and goes into its Hero's graveyard.
------
Tut_M01_Inst02_4
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00008
------
Now make use of your second elemental and attack!
------
Tut_M01_Inst03
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00009
------
You have finished for the moment.
------
Tut_M01_Inst03_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00010
------
To end your turn, press the NEXT button.
------
Tut_M01_Inst03_2
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00011
------
Your opponent will now launch their attacks.
------
Tut_M01_Inst04
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00012
------
Your creatures are not obliged to attack on every turn. Instead of launching an attack, you can order your creatures to move to a different location on the battlefield.
------
Tut_M01_Inst04_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00013
------
Place the air elementals in front of the ghouls.
------
Tut_M01_Inst04_2
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00014
------
To accomplish this task, first select the elemental, then select an empty space in front of an enemy on the battlefield. Remember that your creatures will not be able to attack this turn, as they have moved instead.
------
Tut_M01_Inst05
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00015
------
Let's go back over the engagement on the field of battle. Your air elemental was attacked by the ghoul. The ghoul has an attack value ([ATK]) of 2, thus dealing 2 damage to the elemental.
------
Tut_M01_Inst05_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00016
------
Since your elemental is still standing it will now retaliate using its ([RET]) of 2. This retaliation deals 2 points of damage to the ghoul, killing it and sending it to the graveyard.
------
Tut_M01_Inst05_2
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00017
------
The other ghoul did not attack, so you can finish him off with your elemental.
------
Tut_M01_Inst05_3
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00018
------
Remember, if a creature dies from the [ATK] damage, it won't deal any retaliation damage.
------
Tut_M01_Succ
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00019
------
You did very well. Now let us move on to Resource and Hero management.
------
Tut_M02_Setup
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00020
------
A Hero has appeared to challenge your skills.
------
Tut_M02_Inst01
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00021
------
To even the odds, I will send you a Hero. Just make sure the Hero survives, otherwise all is lost.
------
Tut_M02_Inst01_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00022
------
The 20 in the red circle is the Hero's Health value.
------
Tut_M02_Inst01_2
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00023
------
Creatures that are not blocked by another creature deal their [ATK] damage directly to the enemy Hero.
------
Tut_M02_Inst02
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00024
------
Creatures cannot attack on the turn they are deployed into combat. After all, they are pulled from the reserves and need to reach the battlefield.
------
Tut_M02_Inst02_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00025
------
To deploy a new creature, in other words to play it from your hand and set it down onto the battlefield, you must pay the amount of resources indicated in the upper left corner of the card.
------
Tut_M02_Inst0_2_2
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00026
------
Your enemy will now spend 1 resource to deploy another ghoul.
------
Tut_M02_Inst03
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00027
------
Your enemy’s turn is over and your Supply phase now begins. During this phase your resources will be refilled and increased by 1.
------
Tut_M02_Inst03_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00028
------
You will also draw a new card automatically, after which you will proceed to the Action phase.
------
Tut_M02_Inst03_2
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00029
------
During the Action phase you can deploy new creatures, order creatures to attack and play fortune or spell cards.
------
Tut_M02_Inst04
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00030
------
Your current resources are insufficient to deploy any new creatures. Pass the turn to your enemy for now. You'll be able to deploy a new creature during your next Action phase.
------
Tut_M02_Succ
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00031
------
Excellent work. Now let us move to a full size battleground.
------
Tut_M02_Fail
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00032
------
Failure is an opportunity to learn new tactics and strategies to defeat your opponent in a rematch. Now let us start this combat anew.
------
Tut_M03_Setup
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00033
------
Heroes are at the centre of every battle. They wield special powers, and finding the correct Hero to match your style is the key to victory.
------
Tut_M03_Inst01
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00034
------
To deploy a creature, you must first meet its Might & Magic requirements, which are shown below the Creature’s resource cost.
------
Tut_M03_Inst01_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00035
------
Your current Might is 0 but your Pao Hunter requires a Might of 1 to be deployed.
------
Tut_M03_Inst01_2
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00036
------
Use the Hero’s ability to increase the Might level of your army.
------
Tut_M03_Inst01_3
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00037
------
Heroes can have other abilities than just raising levels, so always read your Hero cards carefully!

ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00038
------
The battleground has grown to its full size. There is now a front line and back line.
------
Tut_M03_Inst03
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00039
------
All creatures fall under one of the 3 categories: Melee, Shooter and Flyer. Melee creatures can only go on the front line.
------
Tut_M03_Inst04
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00040
------
Shooter creatures go on the back line.
------
Tut_M03_Inst05
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00041
------
As for flyer creatures, they can go anywhere.
------
Tut_M03_Inst05_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00042
------
Select your Pao Hunter.
------
Tut_M03_Inst06
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00043
------
Notice that all your shooters have a special ability called 'Immune to Retaliation'. This means that no retaliation damage is dealt to them after an attack.
------
Tut_M03_Inst06_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00044
------
Remember always to read the cards. Even if you know all the basic rules of battle, certain cards can modify those rules.
------
Tut_M03_Inst06_2
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00045
------
Deploy your Pao Hunter to block the enemy skeleton.
------
Tut_M03_Inst07
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00046
------
Defend your shooters from flyer and melee creature attacks by placing another creature in front of them. Watch out though, because shooters can attack any creature in a column, defended or not.
------
Tut_M03_Inst07_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00047
------
Now win this match and prove your worth!
------
Tut_M03_Succ

ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00048
------
Now that you have mastered basic creature and Hero management, we will move on to more complex strategies.
------
Tut_M03_Fail
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00049
------
Failure is an opportunity to learn new tactics and strategies to defeat your opponent in a rematch. Now let us start this combat anew.
------
Tut_M04_Setup
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00050
------
Now that you have mastered the basics I will teach you about spells and fortunes.
------
Tut_M04_Inst01
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00051
------
Like creatures, these cards cost resources to deploy, but you must first meet their Magic or Destiny requirements.
------
Tut_M04_Inst01_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00052
------
If you want to play the Fire Bolt spell to damage an enemy creature, you will first need to raise the Magic level of your army by 1.
------
Tut_M04_Inst01_2
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00053
------
If you want to play the Gold Pile fortune and gain the resources to deploy more creatures, you will first need to raise the Destiny level of your army by 1.
------
Tut_M04_Inst01_3
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00054
------
Use your Hero’s ability to increase the Might, Magic or Destiny level of your army.
------
Tut_M04_Inst02
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00055
------
Like creatures, spells and fortunes can only be played during your turn.
------
Tut_M04_Inst03
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00056
------
But enough talk! Let us now win the day!
------
Tut_M04_Succ
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00057
------
Well played!
------
Tut_M04_Fail
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00058
------
Failure is an opportunity to learn new tactics and strategies to defeat your opponent in a rematch. Now let us start this combat anew.
------
Tut_M05_Setup
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00059
------
Our time together is coming to an end. Let me teach you a few more tactics before I take my leave.
------
Tut_M05_Inst01
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00060
------
Each spell is classed as either 'Immediate' or 'Ongoing'.
------
Tut_M05_Inst01_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00061
------
Ongoing spells, like the Weakness spell just cast by the enemy Hero, will remain on the battleground permanently, or unless specified by other conditions on the card.
------
Tut_M05_Inst01_2
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00062
------
Immediate spells, like Dispel Magic, have effects that trigger instantly and one time only.
------
Tut_M05_Inst01_3
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00063
------
Use Dispel Magic on your afflicted creature to remove the Weakness spell.
------
Tut_M05_Inst02
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00064
------
Each fortune is classed as either 'Immediate', 'Current' or 'Lasting'.
------
Tut_M05_Inst02_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00065
------
Immediate fortunes, like the Gold Pile, have effects that trigger instantly and one time only.
------
Tut_M05_Inst02_2
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00066
------
Current fortunes, like the Ambush Spot, have effects that remain active until the end of your turn.
------
Tut_M05_Inst02_3
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00067
------
Lasting fortunes, like Altar of Shadows, have effects that remain active until the end of your enemy's next turn.
------
Tut_M05_Inst02_4
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00068
------
Always make sure to check the duration of your fortunes and spells before you deploy them!
------
Tut_M05_Inst03
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00069
------
You might have noticed a new Hero ability is now available.
------
Tut_M05_Inst03_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00070
------
When you feel like you don't need to increase any of your levels to play your cards, you can use the Draw a card ability.
------
Tut_M05_Inst04
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00071
------
The battle is in your hands, now finish off your foe!
------
Tut_M05_Succ
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00072
------
Well done my friend. You have one final trial ahead of you so it's time to show me your true colors.
------
Tut_M05_Fail
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00073
------
Failure is an opportunity to learn new tactics and strategies to defeat your opponent in a rematch. Now let us start this combat anew.
------
Tut_M06_Inst01
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00074
------
You are now ready to face a real fight. A true battle is played out with a deck of 50 cards composed of creatures, spells and fortunes. You start a battle with 6 cards in hand.
------
Tut_M06_Inst02
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00075
------
A final aspect is unlocked: Events.
------
Tut_M06_Inst02_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00076
------
Each side will bring to the match 8 event cards of their choice. The 16 event cards are then shuffled together and 2 of them are revealed at random to be active from the start of the battle.
------
Tut_M06_Inst02_2
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00077
------
At every Supply phase, the event to the left is removed, the one to the right moves to the left and a new event card takes its place.
------
Tut_M06_Inst02_3
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00078
------
Take a look for yourself as the enemy finishes his turn…
------
Tut_M06_Inst03
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00079
------
You can use both event cards once per turn as long as you pay their resource costs.
------
Tut_M06_Inst03_1
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00080
------
…but read the conditions carefully, because using one may help your enemy to win!
------
Tut_M06_Succ
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00081
------
You are now ready to build your own decks and battle online foes! Can you rise up the ranks of the leaderboards? Only time will tell, so go and claim your place amongst the heroes!
------
Tut_M06_Fail
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00082
------
Failure is an opportunity to learn new tactics and strategies to defeat your opponent in a rematch. Now let us start this combat anew.
------
Tut_T01_Inst01
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00083
------
Your goal is to bring the enemy Hero's down to 0 Health points!
------
Tut_T01_Inst02
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00084
------
A green border around a card means you can click on it to perform an action.
------
Tut_T01_Inst03
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00085
------
Your Hero can increase the Might, Magic or Fortune level of your army once per turn.
------
Tut_T01_Inst04
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00086
------
To use a card from your hand, you must first meet its level requirements.
------
Tut_T01_Inst05
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00087
------
Then pay its Resource cost.
------
Tut_T01_Inst06
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00088
------
The Attack, Retaliation and Health points of a creature are shown at the bottom left.
------
Tut_T01_Inst07
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00089
------
A creature cannot attack on the same turn it is deployed.
------
Tut_T01_Inst08
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00090
------
Once you have completed all of your actions, click the End Turn button.
------
Tut_T01_Inst09
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00091
------
You can right click (double tap on iPad) on any card for a closer look at its stats and abilities.
------
Tut_T01_Inst10
------
ME_MAIN_TUT_OLD_00092
------
You can also use events on your turn if you pay the cost!

DraftMode_Description

In Draft Mode, you pick cards from random pools and attempt to build the strongest deck possible. You will play matches with this deck until you win 10 times or lose 3 times. The more wins you earn, the better reward you will receive at the end. If you earn enough wins, you'll also have the chance to directly buy any cards from the deck you drafted.
