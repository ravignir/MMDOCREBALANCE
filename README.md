# MMDOCREBALANCE
Rebalance project - Duel of Champions
Changes so far:

Power Blast Titan: Ability does not stack, meaning your titans can only get one additional attack.
Necromancer Reinforcer: Ability does not stack, stack will grow only by 1 per attack.
Shinobi Whisperer: rework "at the start of your turn, if your enemy controls more creatures, return target enemy creature to their owners hand" - one use per Whisperer.
Forbidden Flame: + Damage cannot be prevented or reduced
Bramble Beast: 4 HP
Blackskull Warchanter: Triggers at the start of turn instead.
